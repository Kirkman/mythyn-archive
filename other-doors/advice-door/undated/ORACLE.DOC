             ( * )  Consulting the Oracle of Insight  ( * )
                   ----------------------------------
 
    Many times problems are hard to solve because you are looking in the
same places rather than gaining new insight & new perspectives.  The Oracle
of Insight will help you to solve your problems through ambiguity.  This
method has been used since ancient times through seemingly "mysterious"
means, while the way it functions is rather simple.  Traditionally, the
purpose of using these Oracles was not so much to foretell the future, as
it was to enable the user to delve deeper into his own intuition when
dealing with a problem.  Since people tend to use the same problem-solving
approaches repeatedly, they come up with the same answers.  Since the
Oracle of Insight's advice will be a random piece of information, it forces
you to look at the problem in a new way.

 How to use the Oracle of Insight:

    1 - If you have  a  question  and an open, receptive  mind, then you're
        two-thirds of the way toward making  the Oracle work for you. Let's
        suppose that you're working  on  a project and wonder, "What should
        I be thinking about?  What should I do next?  What's an alternative
        approach?  What aren't I seeing?"  First  off, clear  your  mind...
        Take some time to relax and  focus  your  thinking.  Now  form your
        question.  The Oracle will now ask  you  to  repeat  your  question
        either aloud or mentally; this focuses your thinking.

    2 - Now let the Oracle find a special word that will be the key to
        directing you towards the solution.

    3 - Now think of how the word applies to your situation.  Take as much
        time as you need.  There is a connection between the item the Oracle
        provided and your problem -- and your job is to find it.  As stated
        above, we humans are quite good at finding patterns and meaning in
        the world around us -- even if none was intended.  Thus, whatever
        you find will have a way of adding insight into your problem and
        providing clairification.

            What are different ways in which it relates to or could apply
        to your question?

           Be Creative.
           Go beyond your first answer; look for a second and a third and
        a fifth right answer.
           Be literal in your interpretation.
           Be metaphorical.
           Be off-the-wall.
           Be serious.

           Think of each thing as a stimulant to your imagination.  Let it
        spark a series of fresh associations in your mind.  Like pebbles
        dropping in a pond, they will stimulate other associations, some of
        which may help you find or think of something new.

           Don't worry how practical or logical you are.  What's important
        is where each random thing leads you.

           Most will trigger and immediate response.  Sometimes, however,
        you'll look at one and think, "This doesn't have anything to do
        with my problem," and be tempted to reject it and reach for a new
        one.  Don't do it.  Force yourself to make a connection.  Believe
        that in one way or another everything -- whether it's cow's milk
        or anti-war riots, church services or dried flowers, soap bubbles
        or knight's armor -- is connected to everything else.

           Remember:  often those ideas that initially seem the least
        relevant become the most important ones of all because they point
        to something that you've been completely overlooking.

           For example, if "mothballs" or "water faucets" aren't the
        typical things you think of when dealing with a problem, then your
        responses to these ideas are likely to give you new insight into
        your question.

           When should you consult the Oracle for another random idea?
        When you've finished the current one.  It might be right now, or
        it might be next week.
