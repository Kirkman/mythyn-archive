The Advice Door
===============

The Advice Door was a door program for FoReM ST BBSes, created by Paul Witte of Mythyn Software, that allowed users to give and receive anonymous advice for problems or issues they were facing. 

This directory includes the source code for two versions of The Advice Door: 

* The Pascal file in `/1991-02-20/` bears that date. A message in the code indicates it is version 1.5.

* The files in `/undated/` bear the default Atari ST creation date of 1985-11-20, but they clearly are later than the first set. A message in the code indicates these files are for version 2.5, and the code includes many additional functions and more complexity.
