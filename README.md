Mythyn source code repository
=============================

This repository contains the source code to several BBS doors and games for the Atari ST written by Paul Witte of Mythyn Software, including the game Thieves' Guild.


Thieves' Guild
--------------

Thieves' Guild is a BBS door game for the Atari ST. The game was written in Pascal using OSS's Personal Pascal compiler. It was later ported to Turbo Pascal for the PC. Mythyn also produced a graphical front-end client for Thieves' Guild.

The source code for these projects can be found in `/thieves-guild/` folder.


Other doors
-----------

Witte also created several other informational or entertainment doors, meant to be used with FoReM ST BBS software, including an advice door, a graffiti wall, and a chat module.

The source code for these projects can be found in the `/other-doors/` folder.
