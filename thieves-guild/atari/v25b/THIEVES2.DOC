     | Towns & Travel |
   -=******************=-

         There are 25 towns in all throughout the land, and each is individual
and unique.  As mentioned above, option #0 on the main menu is reserved for any
"special" place available only in that town.  Many of these special town features
are essential to solving your quest to return home.  Though almost every town has
a special aspect, only 3 will be described in detail (The Stable, The Thieves'
Guild, and Temples), the rest are for you to discover.  As you venture forth,
and converse with other inhabitants of the land you may gain hints to what is
where.  It is wise to do price shopping, as no two towns offer identical price
ranges.  Prices in Shoppes, Taverns, Inns, Wizard's Guilds, and ship yards all
vary greatly.  Some towns offer certain goods not found elsewhere, so be sure
to explore a great deal when arriving at a town new to you.  You have the option
of viewing town status at the main menu which includes:  A brief town description,
population, guards, and alignment.  The usefulness of this information is
explained throughout this documentation.

   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))
    )) Sailing the Seas! ((
   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))

         All towns are connected via specific travel routes, when travelling
you are shown a list of all nearby towns.  The time necessary for a specific
voyage depend on several factors:  Distance, Weather, Ship/Horse Quality.
Before you may sail, you obviously must first purchase a boat.  You may talk
to a merchant at the Harbor (that is if the town you are in is by the ocean).
There are several different ship types such as rafts, canoes, sail ships, and
best of all, galleys.  The better the ship, the faster it will take you to your
destination.  Better ships also have better Hulls, which means they are less
likely to sink in adverse conditions (see Chapter 15 ~ Conflicts & Combat for
more information).  It is always wise to hire some sailors if your vessel is
big enough to carry them.  Sailors will help you fend off bad weather, sea
monsters, whirlpools, pirates, and other possible mishaps.  The longer your
voyage, the more likely you'll encounter these.  After you buy a ship it will
always be with you, as it will be moved to new harbors if necessary.  For
larger vessels, winds are required; watch the current weather conditions.  If
you notice banners flying the wind, dust being stirred in the streets, these
are most opportune times (though weather may change after you already set off).
Special ship items are rumoured to be available from select individuals.

   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))
    )) Land Travel ((
   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))

         There are many dark forest roads to guide the way.  Walking is one
way of getting around, but you may end up using all 24 hours of your day!
Travel by land should only be done on horseback!!  There is a Stable just South
of Arisilon (your starting point) in Jarsoloth.  Two types of horses are available,
Travel Horses, and War Horses.  Horses for travel are fine, but only half as fast
as a War Horse.  Though war horses are more expensive, they are worth it.  A
war horse is also less likely to be killed by a foe lurking in the shadows, and
will help you fight by kicking the enemy.  A travel horse should only be purchased
if that is all you can afford.  War horses may be purchased with up to 24 hit
points, for every 2 hit points your horse has it will travel one hour faster.
When you buy your horse you may give it a name, it's your new travelling companion!
Some have made reference to a horse training organization of the East.

Maps of all towns & travel routes are available.  They are EXTREMELY helpful
and full of stunning art work.  They are printed on parchment paper, airbrushed
by hand, and full of hints!  They may be obtained by mail (within a week), talk
to the InnKeeper or look at Section IV ~ Credits in this documentation for more
information.

   -=***********=-
     | Casinos |
   -=***********=-

         Feeling lucky?  Try your hand at the games!  Watch your back
though, the pit boss isn't known to be a subtle loser (not a subtle winner
either for that matter)!

   -=***********=-
     | Taverns |
   -=***********=-

         All adventurers are familiar with the cozy atmosphere of the local
taverns.  This is a place to relax, socialize, and of course eat & drink!
There are however even more advantages to these gathering places, some not
quite as apparent.  Many wise and experienced travellers may share their
knowledge with you.  If you intend to succeed in your quest, and in over
coming your advesaries this cannot be over looked.

    Food & Drink - Not all food is safe to eat, and unfortunately food
                   poisoning is not uncommon.  When selecting from the
                   menu it is wise to purchase the more expensive items
                   towards the end of the menu.  The more you pay, the
                   longer your hunger or thirst will be satisifed.  Don't
                   forget to tip the bartender!  He usually has a new
                   secret to share for every additional 100 gold pieces
                   you give him.  A wise man indeed!!!

    Jobs - Is your purse losing weight?  Jobs are frequently available,
           but often require decent apparel.
       
    Talking to Patrons - Relax & converse with the town folk!  They often
                         have important information to share with you.  Be
                         cautious however, not all are fond of new faces!

    Talking with the Bartender - Perhaps on rare occasions the bartender
                                 will have some time to speak with you.
                                 Just try to get his attention!

    Speak to a Guild Member - You may speak with any other theif that is
                              currently in town with you...

    Say something to everyone - Go ahead & yell out loud!  All will hear
                                what you have to say!

    Give someone some gold - Have a friend in need?  Sharing can be an
                             asset indeed!

    Listening & Telling Guild Rumours - Listen & tell rumours to the other
                                        thieves of the realm!

    STEAL!! - Food, wine, and gold lie behind the counter, perhaps when
              the Bartender is not looking you could relieve him of some!

   -=********=-
     | Inns |
   -=********=-

         The cozy warmth of a fireplace, warm blankets of furr, and rooms
to ensure you are not disturbed are all available for a price.  Rooms of
various sizes and quality may be used at various rates.  The nicer the room
is, the better you will sleep.  Most Inn Keepers will let you sleep for up
to 12 hours at a time.

         Clocks & time pieces are rare in the land.  All Inns have a clock
which you may look at to plan your visits.  Because most all shoppes and
buildings are only available during specific hours, the Inn's clock is very
useful.  Fortunately Inns are open to visitors 24 hours a day.

         If your low on gold, perhaps the Inn Keeper will have a job for
you.  If not, you can always sneak behind the counter while he's away!

  The Inn Keeper may also let you know how to obtain a maps of the lands!

   -=***********=-
     | Temples |
   -=***********=-

         In the ongoing battle between order & chaos, institutions have
been organized.  Three prominent Gods are known throughout the lands.  Each
one of a seperate alignment:  Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.  Temples for
each of the Gods have been erected, in 3 different towns.  Generally the
influence of each temple radiates to the nearby towns.  The north-west is
known to be Lawful, the south is known to be Neutral, and the north-east
is known to be Chaotic.

         To join a particular religion you may be baptized or initiated
at the temple, for a ceremonial fee.  It is best to avoid towns of your
opposing alignment, and it's not wise to visit a temple of another religion.
You may convert to another religion, but the ceremonial fees are higher.

Here is a description of each God and what they stand for:

 * SOLNAR, Keeper of the Flame -- A lawful, righteous God of light!  Join
                                  if you seek peace, love, and improvement
                                  of self.  The 1st moon, the silver cresent
                                  in the heavens, represents his glory.

 * CATHRA, Goddess of Light -- The Neutral Goddess of the morning!  Seek her
                               mothering guidance if you seek justice,
                               knowledge, and purity.  The 2nd moon, the
                               pale light in the night sky, represents her
                               reign.

 * BALOR, Lord of the Night -- The Chaotic ruler of darkness!  Melt your soul
                               with his fiery kingdom if you desire vengence,
                               downfall, and destruction!  The 3rd moon, the
                               crimson disc of the night's blackness, echoes
                               his name.

         There are two major advantages to joining a religion.  One of these
are the temple services.  Anytime you visit your temple you may praise your
God for one hour.  You will be instantly healed of all wounds, and your
energy will increase.  The other, and probably most beneficial aspect of
religions, is added Wizard's Guild privilages!  You will be offered an
additional 7 spells at the Wizard's Guild.  These are only offered at
Wizard's Guilds in a town of your own religions alignment!!!

 (See Chapter 8 ~ Wizard's Guilds for a description of these spells)

   -=**********************=-
     | The Thieves' Guild |
   -=**********************=-

         Hidden deep within the aspen forests, in the northern mountains
of Rouge's Isle, lies the gathering place of Theives.  This is where you
found yourself when you first arrived in the Realm.  Here you will find
lessons in the art of Thievery.  Training sessions last 5 hours, and will
increase your skill up to 5 additional points.  This is a superb way for
the new thief to progress quickly.

         The Thieves' Guild is also a place for you to advance in your
experience levels.  When you have noticed you've gone up a level (by viewing
your stats), you may come for level advancement.  If the Master Thief finds
you deserving you will be given a new weapon & armour.  Your hit points will
also be increased.  It is wise not to advance too many levels before returning
to the Thieves' Guild.  Here is a list of each expereince level, and the skill
points needed to achieve each of them:

      Skill Range      Experience  Level
     (-)(-)-(-)(-)     -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

      0 - 84            Apprentice
      85 - 104          Footpad
      105 - 124         Robber
      125 - 144         Burglar
      145 - 164         Cutpurse
      165 - 184         Sharper
      185 - 204         Pilferer
      205 - 224         Thief
      225 - 264         Master Thief
      265 - 304         10th Level Master Thief
      305 - 344         11th Level Master Thief
      345 - 384         12th Level Master Thief
      385 - 455         13th Level Master Thief
      456 & Up          14th Level Master Thief

         You will be given a better weapon, and better armour with each
level advancement!  For more information on combat & weaponry, see Chapter
15 ~ Conflict & Combat.

         At the Theieves' Guild you may also purchase magical poison darts,
these, if they hit, will poison your foe.  See Chapter 14 ~ Magic Items for
information on how to use them.

   -=*****************=-
     | Wizard Guilds |
   -=*****************=-

         There are many masters of the magical arts throughout the realm,
and some make their services available for a fee.  Wizard's Guilds are
found in almost every town, here you may visit and take advantage of both
their healing & destructive forces.  There are 7 basic spells that every
guild provides, though prices may vary greatly.  However, as mentioned
in the Religion chapter of this documentation, there are 7 additional
spells available only to those belonging to a particular faith.

         The spells suit the religion to which you belong, that is, if you
belong to the religion of Balor, your 7 additional spells are mostly for
destructive purposes, to harm your enemy.  Following are the 7 basic spells
available in every Wizard's Guild, regardless of your religion:

   1. Raise thy skill -- This enables you to pay a wizard to raise your
                         skill by magical means.  This is a quick  way to
                         get large amounts of skill points.  The price
                         per point gets more expensive depending on your
                         current skill.  You may buy 50 skill points max
                         at a time (it is a good idea to wait until you
                         can afford 50 skill at one time since the price
                         goes up the more you buy).


    2. Read someone's mind -- If the theif has no mind protection, this
                              enables you to find out how much gold they
                              have ON HAND only (not how much they have in
                              the bank).  This is useful to find out how
                              close your enemy is to going broke. You may
                              only cast this spell on someone who is in
                              town with you.

    3. Protect thy mind -- You may hire a wizard to protect your mind
                           from hostile magic such as Cursing, Mind reading,
                           Balorian sleep spells, and Balorian Death Gazes.
                           Mind Protection is purchased by how many days
                           you desire.  Once purchased, the only way it
                           may be destroyed is by a Balorian Mind Crush
                           spell.  It is wise to keep mind protection if
                           you have a lot of enemies.

    4. Curse thy foe -- If you wish to cause harm upon your enemy, this
                        is an option.  After cursing the victim will
                        IMMEDIATELY lose 10 skill, and be Parched,
                        Starving, and stricken with Severe Fatigue.
                        Anyone without Mind Protection may be cursed. It
                        is sometimes wise to attempt to read someone's
                        mind before you curse them (to make sure they
                        don't have mind protection), since mind reading
                        is much cheaper.  The victim must be in town.

    5. Send a telepathic message -- This allows you to send a message
                                    to another thief even if he isn't in
                                    town with you.  Communicating in the
                                    Tavern allows you to speak only to
                                    those in town with you.

    6. Cure ALL of thy ailments -- The clerics of the guild will cure
                                   you of all ailments, such as poison,
                                   or any other strange ailment which
                                   might befall you.  This does NOT
                                   restore hit points.

    7. Heal -- An essential spell to keep your character alive. Rather
               than roaming the streets or tavern in search of a friendly
               cleric or priest, you may have your hit points restored
               here.  Price is for each hit point to be healed.

Here are the additional 7 spells for each religion, remember that these
spells are available ONLY in a town whose alignment is the same as your
current faith.  Because temples (where you get baptized into a religion)
are only available in the REGISTERED version of Thieves' Guild, these
spells will only be possible if your sysop is running a registered version
of Thieves' Guild:

  --*-- /@ Solnarian Spells @\ --*--
          [Lawful Alignment]

    1. Invisibility -- Purchased by individual days, this allows you to
                       be more transparent to other theives.  Any time
                       other players view the list of thieves in town,
                       you will NOT be shown on the list.  If, however,
                       they select your player letter at the prompt
                       they will see you, and be able to interact with
                       you.

    2. Anti-Theft -- Exactly the same as the 3 day theft protection you
                     receive in the beginning.  No one may steal from you
                     while you've got it.  Once purchased (on a "by-day"
                     basis), it will stay with you as long as you don't
                     attempt to steal from anyone else.

    3. Increase hit points -- One of Solnarians best spells!  This allows
                              you to buy addition hit points (that is your
                              maximum hit points), rather than depending
                              on your level advances at the Thieves' Guild.

    4. Teleport Item -- Because of the generous nature of Solnarians, this
                        spell allows you to send gold to another thief
                        even if he/she is not in town with you.

    5. Enchant Weapon/Armour -- Increase the power & strength of your
                                current weapon or armour! Be cautioned
                                though, enchanted wares seem to take on
                                a life of their own!

    6. Transport -- When casted upon another theif, you will exchange
                    locations.  A great way to get quickly to a desired
                    town!  Also a great way to keep foes from getting to
                    where they want to go!

    7. Location -- Find out in which town a thief currently resides. It
                   is a good idea to cast this before a Transport spell
                   so you know what your destination will be!

         [Neutral  Alignment]

    1. Global Search -- This will list ALL thieves and the town they are
                        currently in.  A great spell to cast before a
                        transport spell if you have a particular
                        destination in mind!

    2. Universal Curse -- Exactly the same as regular Curse spell only
                          your foe doesn't have to be in town with you.

    3. Universal Mind Read -- Exactly the same as a regular mind read
                              except they need not be in town.

    4. Teleport Item -- Same as Solnarian Teleport Item spell (see above).

    5. Kill Assassin -- It is possible for your foe to hire a group of
                        assassins to seek your blood, this will destroy
                        them before they destroy you.

    6. Transport -- Same as Solnarian Transport spell (see above).

    7. Location -- Same as Solnarian Location spell (see above).

  --*-- /@ Balorian Spells @\ --*--
         [Chaotic Alignment]

    1. Sleep Spell -- This causes a deep sleep to befall your foe.  Your
                      enemy will lose several hours of precious time in
                      the realm, and there will be no benefical effects
                      of the sleep (if they were tired, they will still be
                      just a tired as before the spell).  Be cautioned,
                      you foe MUST have a full 24 hours left for that day
                      or the spell will fail!  Mind Protection also guards
                      against this spell.

    2. Universal Curse -- Same as Catharian Universal Curse (see above).

    3. Universal Mind Read -- Same as Catharian Universal Mind Read (see
                              above).

    4. Balorian Gaze of Death!!! -- This is the most HORRIBLE, Ruthless,
                                    and cruel thing to do to an enemy!!!
                                    Your foe will immediately lose 1/8th
                                    score, and 1/4th of their skill! Not
                                    only will your foe be Parched, Starving
                                    and stricken with Severe Fatigue, but
                                    it will take a long time to restore
                                    these!  Your foe must be in an evil
                                    town, and without mind protection.

    5. Kill Assassin -- Same as Catharian Kill Assassin spell (see above).

    6. Mind Crush -- The ONLY way to destroy someone's mind protection so
                     you can send destructive magic their way!  Your foe
                     must be in a town of Evil Alignment at the time or
                     the spell will fail.

    7. Location -- Same as Solnarian Location Spell (see above).

Remember of course, as with the rest of this game, there are exceptions.
Certain guilds may provide "extra" services that are not found anywhere
else in the land.  I am not going to reveal the nature or location of
them, it's up to you to find them...

   -=*********=-
     | Banks |
   -=*********=-

         Every town in the realm offers a bank, but not all are created
equal...  Each bank offers different interest rates.  Be sure to keep in
mind that gold in the bank is not gold you have on hand.  So if someone
steals your last gold piece from you, you are kicked out of the Thieves'
Guild and must start anew (regardless if you have gold in the bank or not)!

         All banks are united, if you deposit your gold in one bank, you
can withdraw it from a bank in another town.  The daily interest rate you
are getting paid however, is the interest rate of the bank in which you
opened your account.  If you visit another town who's bank is paying higher
interest rates, it is a good idea to close your account & re-open it there!

         The last thing to consider when going to banks is the chance of
robbery.  Early in the progression of thieves your gold is fairly safe, as
it is difficult to rob the bank.  When thieves gain in skill however, your
chances of losing gold to fellow thieves is high.  Interest is paid right
after midnight, so if you are fortunate enough to be in before midnight,
deposit your gold then take it out after midnight!

         Here's what you may do at the Banks...

    Open an account - You may open an account at the bank, but you may only
                      have one account open at a time.  If you aren't sure
                      how much interest you are getting paid you can try
                      to open another account and you will be told.

    Close an account - By closing an account you will withdraw ALL your
                       gold.  You then may open another account somewhere
                       else.

    Withdraw from account - You may take gold out of your account at any
                            time, maximum 30,000 gold per transaction, at
                            least 1 gold piece must remain in the account
                            to keep it active.  If you want to take out all
                            the gold you must close your account.

    Deposit to account - You may put as much gold in your account as you
                         wish.  If your account has more than 99,999 gold
                         pieces in it you will not be paid interest.
                         Remember to always keep adequate gold on hand so
                         nobody causes you to go broke!

    Apply for a job - Banks are known to pay very well!

    Steal the Bankbooks! - Thinking about robbing the bank?  Want to know
                           how much gold your foe has?  By stealing the
                           bankbooks you will see the size of everyone's
                           stores!

    Rob the Bank! - VERY difficult except for the most experienced of
                    thieves!!  Penalties begin at 2 days in jail rather
                    than just 1.

   -=***********=-
     | Shoppes |
   -=***********=-

         Cloaks, hats, tunics, clothing of all colors & qualities are
offered here!  Certain shoppes are known to sell a rare selection of wares.
Dress yourself to fit your personality!  It is also wise for thieves to
change clothing regularly to prevent detection.  Most shoppe merchants are
willing to haggle on the prices, but are easily offended.

         When you successfully steal from a fellow guild member, all they
notice about you is your clothing, so change it often!

         It is always possible to avoid the merchant altogether and grab
something off the shelf!  No telling what you might get away with...

   -=*********=-
     | Jails |
   -=*********=-

         The jails are usually quite populated with those in the business
of thievery!  You may visit the jail and peer in the cells.  Have a friend
behind bars?  Pay bail, or, organize an escape!  Just be sure you don't
become a roommate!  Bail generally runs 500 gps/day.

Civ Steal  SFOGM 12 ~ The crafty art of Thievery (paying bail, escaping guards)

   -=************************=-
     | The art of Thievery! |
   -=************************=-

         As a member of the Thieves' Guild, the majority of your prosperity
and success will come from pilfery.  It is wise in the beginning to avoid
stealing until your skill has increased considerably.  When stealing anywhere
(except from other Guild Members), if you fail guards will come after you.  When
confronted with guards you have several options:  Attack them (you only get this
option if your skill is within a specific range), try to escape, pay bail, or go
to jail.  In most circumstances the penalty for a theft is one day in jail, if
the crime is more serious (such as a bank robbery attempt) the penatly is two
days.  If you go to jail and cannot afford bail, you must either wait until after
midnight (so you'll be out), or have a friend get you out.  See Chapter 11 ~ Jails
for more information.  If you try to escape and fail, then you will be penalized
with an extra day in the musty cell.

         Even if you have less than 100 skill it's not a bad idea to try to steal
from the Inn or Tavern when you have less than 3 hours left in the game (since 3
hours aren't much, and you'll be out the next day), but don't try to escape from
guards!  For regular theft attempts it's best to wait until you have around 150-
200 skill, but it also depends on how many guards are in town.  You may view the
town status to see the number of guards, the more there are, the more difficult
it will be to succeed.  Keep records of the towns you visit, find a town with very
few guards if you wish to steal from Inns, Banks, Taverns, Shoppes & the like.
Success in helping a friend out of jail are also influenced by guards (as well
as trying to escape the guards).  Escaping guards gets easier with more skill.

          There is an exception to this.  Stealing from civilians (pick-pocketing)
is not at all influenced by guards in town, it isn't even influenced much by your
current skill level.  When you wish you pick-pocket find a town with a high population,
the higher the better!!!  Even the least experienced of thieves may participate
in this activity (they just might not get as much gold).  Be careful however, if
the guards don't come after you, the victim will!  Prepare to use your weapon if
need be, nobody likes a thief's hand in his purse!

           Stealing from other Thieves' (Guild Members) is also very different...
Your success/failure ratio is in no way influenced by guards.  It is based on your
current skill points, and the skill points of the victim.  If your skill is equal
to each other then you've got a 50/50 chance of success.  If you steal your victim's
last gold piece then he/she is kicked out of the guild and must start over!!!  When
you succeed, you will also steal one of their skill points.  If you fail, they get
one of your skill points.  It is against guild ethics to steal from a player who's
skill you triple.  You also may not steal from a thief with Theft Protection.
If you try to steal from someone and fail, they will see your name in their "Events
while Gone", if you succeed then they will see one item of your clothing.  You are
only allowed 5 guild member steals per day.

Thievery, by far, will be the greatest source of income.

   -=**********************************=-
     | Inventory and Character Status |
   -=**********************************=-

         You have the option to view your status at any time.  By doing so you
will be shown all your statistics, such as:  Name,  Skill, Experience Level,
Weapon, Armour, Ship, Horse, Clothing, Religion, Gold, Theft Protection, Mind
Protection, Invisibility, etc.  Immediately prior to viewing your status you will
be asked if you wish to use one of your Magic Items.  See Chapter 14 ~ Magic
Items for more information on this.

         There is another option on the main menu which will allow you to view
the status of other players.  If another thief is in town with you you may look
at them, the information provided is limited.  You will see their clothing, horse
weapon/armour, and hit points.  If you desire more information, such as how much
gold they are carrying, you will have to read their mind.  See Chapter 8 ~ Wizard's
Guilds for more information on this.

   -=***************=-
     | Magic Items |
   -=***************=-

         Wands, rings, potions, and many other items which have been charged with
special energies by wizards.  When first entering the realm you are give no magic
items whatsoever, but many are found through the land.  When looking through your
treasure after killing your foe, look carefully for anything magic.  To view your
magic items, select option #13 "View thy status" on the main menu.  Just before
viewing your status you are asked if you wish to use a magic item.  You will be
shown a list of all the magic items you have.  If you wish to use one, just enter
the number beside it.  In most cases, the first time you use a magic item, you
will not know it's effect or purpose.  Only after using a magic item you can be
sure.  Sometimes you won't even notice an effect!  It is your job to figure out
what it's for and how/where you need to use it.  BEWARE!  Though few, some magic
items are dangerous!  Some evil magic items are meant only to bring downfall upon
the practitioner.  Through experimentation, and experience you will learn how
to harness the many advantages of these mysterious trinkets.  Many magic items
are essential to solving your quest!!

         Potions are different than most magic items.  They must be either used
immediately or discarded.  Some potions are beneficial while others are very
harmful.  Each potion has a distinct color, it is a **VERY** good idea to write
down a potions color & it's effect once discovered!  This will let you know what
to do in the future when you find that potion again.

         Magic items are found in a wide variety of locations.  Some you'll
find in treasure chests, some you may even find just lying in the street!  Or
perhaps maybe some kind soul may give you one for no apparent reason!

   -=*********************=-
     | Conflict & Combat |
   -=*********************=-

         Not all inhabitants of the realm are friendly, and no doubt the
time will come to defend yourself!  Upon entering the realm you are provided
will only a dagger & clothing.  Better weapons & armour may be obtained at
the Theives' Guild, for more information, see Chapter 7 ~ The Theives' Guild.

         Your thief has hit points, which are familiar to those who play
role playing games.  They are your life's essence, and when they are gone,
your character dies.  You may be healed at the Wizard's Guild, by potions,
or by a friendly Cleric/Priest seen wandering the streets or Tavern.

         You will be challenged by civilians occasionally if you are pick-
pocketing, and even some will challenge you on the streets without cause.
Patrons in taverns, wild animals, monsters at sea, dark travel routes, enemies
are found all throughout the land.  Here we will explain some of the attack
strategies.  You will notice that in the beginning that MANY enemies will
challenge you, but then refuse to fight you because you are so weak.  If your
hit point maximum is too low, then some creatures will turn you down.  This is
to protect you as you become more powerful.  It is dangerous to have low skill,
and a lot of hit points!!  Skill & Hit points are the key to effective self
defense (a nice weapon/armour don't hurt either!).  When engaged in combat you
are given a list of attack techniques, they are different depending on the
weapon you have.  Here is an example:

                             [1] Defensive Strike

                       [2] Slash     *-*-*-*   [3] Stab
                       [4] Thrust!    *-*-*    [5] Lunge!

                            [6] Two-Handed Attack!!!
                             >> [T]ry to Escape! <<

        If you choose a higher attack style, such as #6, you will be less
likely to hit, however, if you do hit you'll do more damage!  It is possible
for your foe to knock your weapon out of your hand, if this happens you will
have the option of fighting bare-handed, or to attempt to recover your weapon.
Once you've chosen your attack style, you then may choose a target:  Head,
Chest, Arms, or Legs.  If you go for the head, you may do slightly less damage,
but there is a chance you will stun your foe, rendering them unable to attack
for some time.  If you go for the legs, you may knock them down.  If you attack
their arms, you may knock their weapon out of their hands.  The best target
to do damage is the Chest, but there is no chance of putting your foe out of
commission for some time.

        Occasionally, when your foe is close to death, they may beg for mercy
or flee the battlefield.  If you are close to death, and you know that you are
about to recieve a fatal blow, you may drop carrier (hang up) your modem.  Be
sure you do it BEFORE you lose your last hit point however, Thieves' Guild saves
all information when carrier is lost, but does not save the fact that you were
in a fight (***NOTE:  On many BBSs it is considered rude to hang up while online,
many sysops discourage it!  Be sure you know where your sysop stand on this before
hanging up).

         If you are travelling while attacked, things are slightly different.
If sailing, your foe will not attack you, it will attack your vessel.  Your
vessel's Hull Points are like your hit points.  When the Hull is gone, your vessel
is destroyed.  When you successfully arrive at your destination your ship is
repaired at the Harbor.  If travelling by land, your horse will help you attack
your foe, but your foe will also occasionally attack your horse!

         After a battle you get the reward!  You will receieve additional score,
and if it's been a particularly tough battle, you may also receive skill & hit
points.

         You may also find a treasure chest, which may contain a lot of junk,
or a lot of wares!  Gold & magic items are the most benefical items found after
a battle.  Watch carefully for a magic item when looking in the chest!  Junk
such as dishes, rags, & other unimportant objects are discarded.

         See Chapter 14 ~ Magic Items for more information on these.
