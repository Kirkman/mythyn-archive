The following files should have been in the archive:

           EDITOR.TOS - This is the Editor, used to install new games, edit
                        the THIEVES.SET file, and delete/edit players.

          THIEVES.TOS - This is the main executable file.

            SYSOP.DOC - This documentation.

          THIEVES.DOC - This is the game documentation file.

          THIEVES.DAT - This is the file where player's information is kept.

          THIEVES.SET - This is an ASCII text file where paths are set for
                        events files, and game files.  This is also where you
                        tell Thieves' Guild what BBS Software you are using.
                        This may be edited with EDITOR.TOS, or with any ascii
                        text editor.

          THIEVES.SCR - This is the VT52 intro screen.

          RUMOURS.DAT - This file contains GUILD RUMOURS (rumours entered by
                        players).  This may be edited provided that the number at
                        the top of the file is equal to the number of rumours in
                        the file.  Each rumour may not exceed 80 characters.

            TOWNS.DAT - This is the file that stores all vital town info.

         This program is SHAREWARE, which means you are free to use it for a
limited time.  *MANY* features have been stripped from this program, in fact,
the Registered version is ___K larger than this program.  If you would like to
take a look at the Registered version in action, call our support BBS.

         The Unregistered version was not meant to be used permantly.  A list of
Registered features are found at the end of this documentation.  This game is the
product of years of effort, planning, programming, testing, and many late nights
at the keyboard.  Your support would be GREATLY appreciated.

         If you and your users enjoy the world of Thieves' Guild, please print
out the file REGISTER.DOC, and fill out the form.  If you don't have a printer,
just write the appropriate information on a blank piece of paper.

         We very much enjoy comments from those who use our software!!  We
encourage you to call & let us know what you think!  At any rate, please enjoy
this program and give copies to your friends!

         Be sure to also download EMULATE.LZH if you haven't already done so.
Put a copy of it on your BBS for users to download.  The emulator makes Thieves'
Guild come alive even more with spectacular Graphics, Animation, Speed, & Sound!
A copy of it should be available at the same place you obtained this program.
The Emulator is public domain so feel free to distribute it at Computer User's
Groups, or in ShareWare libraries.

          ** QUALITY SHAREWARE CAN ONLY EXIST WITH -YOUR- SUPPORT!! **

    | Installation |
  -=****************=-

         Step #1: Decide on a Path/Folder which will hold all your Thieves'
                  Guild files.  On my system I use C:\FOREM\THIEVES\ ...
                  Create the new folder and copy ALL the files included with
                  this archive into it.

         Step #2: Create another folder (preferably inside the folder you just
                  created) to hold all the "Events While Gone" files.  I use
                  C:\FOREM\THIEVES\DATA\.

         Step #3: Now load EDITOR.TOS on your Hard Drive in the Thieves Path.
                  The Editor program makes installation easy, and makes game
                  maintenance clean & simple.  With it you may also edit enteries
                  in the setup file THIEVES.SET; it stores information such as
                  Paths, ascii data filenames, and BBS type.

            The lines in THIEVES.SET are as follows:

               Line 1: Data Path -- (ie C:\FOREM\THIEVES\DATA\)

                       This is the path you chose, & created
                       for the "Events While Gone" files.

               Line 2: Thieves Path -- (ie C:\FOREM\THIEVES\)

                       This is the path you created for all
                       the Thieves' Guild files.

               Line 3: Events Path & filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\EVENTS.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file for viewing the game Events which have
                       transpired today.

               Line 4: Yesterday Events Path & Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\YEVENTS.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file for viewing Events from Yesterday.

               Line 5: Scores Path & Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\SCORES.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file containing a list of all current players
                       with skill, scores, religion, and current Guild Master.

               Line 6: Guild Masters Path & Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\MASTERS.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file listing all Guild Masters from past
                       months.

               Line 8: BBS Program -- (ie FOREM, EXPRESS, or OTHER)

                       Thieves' Guild is written to work with Forem's DORINFO1.DEF
                       file, or EXPRESS's method of passing the username in.  Mainly
                       because almost all other BBS programs are compatible with
                       either of these two methods.  If your BBS program is NOT
                       capable of this, then select [O]ther.  The game will then
                       run with password.  If you go by [O]ther then it will be
                       possible for users to have more than one character in the
                       game; so by all means only use the password system as a last
                       resort!

               Line 9: Forem Data File -- (ie C:\FOREM\DOORS\DORINFO1.DEF)

                       If you are using forem, this is the location & filename
                       which holds the username information.  Inside the file,
                       the user's first name is on line 7, last name is on
                       line 8.

                       If you are not using FOREM then this line of the .SET file is
                       ignored, and doesn't even need to be there.

           You may want to make the ASCII files (Events, Yesterday Events,
           Scores, & Guild Masters) viewable on your BBS somewhere.  Players
           may view them from within the game as well, however...

           More about the Editor later, for now just select [I]nitialize
           new game.  This option is for first-time installation only.
           You will sequentially be asked for paths & filenames which will
           be used by the game; so have an idea of where you want them.

         Step #4: After answering all the questions, press 'Q' to quit the
                  editor, BE SURE to save all the changed information.
                  Next, copy the now modified THIEVES.SET file to the
                  path/folder your BBS is executed from.

         Step #5: Thieves' Guild is now Installed!!  The only thing you need
                  do now is add it to your BBS's DOORS menu.  You will also
                  need to pass in the parameter "LOCAL" for the game to run
                  while executed locally (not over the modem).  For Forem, the
                  entry in your FDOORS.DAT file would look something like this:

                       -=* The Thieves' Guild *=-
                       10
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.WEL
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.TOS
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.TOS Local
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.EXI

                  If you chose EXPRESS as your BBS type then you must pass in
                  the user's name after the LOCAL parameter.  Remember only pass
                  in the LOCAL parameter for games NOT being played over the
                  modem.

  -=**************=-
    | The Editor |
  -=**************=-

         Apart from editing the THIEVES.SET file, the editor is capable of a few
other things.  Use "[C]reate a new game" to reset the game in progress.

         If your THIEVES.DAT file ever happens to go corrupt for some strange
reason, you can have the editor create a new one by just deleting the old one
and running the editor.

         You also have the option of editing a player (no, not to cheat :).
If you change the user's name on the BBS, then you also need to change the
player's BBS name with the editor so Thieves' Guild will still recognize them.
You may also change a player's game name, or delete a player.

         There is an option of setting a player's "last play day to today".
This you can use to prevent a user from being deleted due to inactivity (a
nice thing to do for one of your user's that is going on vacation).  The
inactivity limit is 10 days, if a user does not play for 10 days straight,
they are deleted to free up slots.
