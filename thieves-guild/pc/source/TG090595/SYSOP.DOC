                                INTRODUCTION:
                                ------------


        An introduction describing the game will be released soon.

                                REQUIREMENTS:
                                ------------
        At this point in time the only requirements are FILES=10 (or more)
        in your config.sys file and ANSI.SYS. SHARE must also be loaded IF
        you intend to use the game in a multi-node environment OR under
        DesqView. The game is RIP aware but NOT a RIP Game at this time. A
        FOSSIL is NOT required to run the game, although one will be
        supported if it exists. Automatic time slicing support is provided
        to most common multi-taskers as well.

                           Installation
                           ------------

        1. Create a directory for the game:
            example: "PCB\DOORS\THIEVES"

        2. Make sure that ALL files listed above from the game package
           are moved into that directory.

        3. Type "DDSETUP.EXE" and hit the enter key. The first thing it
           will ask you is what the name of the CTL file is. Type in
           "THIEVES.CTL" and then proceed to the other settings. After
           you are done the THIEVES.CTL file should be correctly configured.
           Two versions of a fully commented CTL file are provided for
           manual configuration.  One is identified by the game title
           (example: THIEVES.CTL) and this is the UN-EDITED version and the
           other is identified as SAMPLE.CTL is what a CTL file should look
           like AFTER it is edited.  If all else fails - try the one I use
           on MY support BBS (Sample.CTL). If you have fossil drivers be
           sure to uncomment the 'fossil' option.  If you have a modem set
           to a non-std IRQ be sure to use the PORT# option for that com
           port. A CTL file generated by DDSETUP.EXE will have NO comments
           and look quite different from my samples, but they WILL work
           just as well, never fear.

           Where to put this file?
           Put this file wherever you are running the game executable file
           from. If you are running multi-node you could put a copy in each
           node directory and run from there.  If you change directory to
           the GAME directory put the file here.  See the example
           SAMPLE#.bat files.

        4. Run the TGEDIT.EXE file to initialize and setup the game.

        5. To insure proper multi-node use DOS SHARE must be loaded
           prior to the game and prior to DESQview.

        6. In order to run the game program online the following
           parameters may be used.

        "/Bxxxxx"   This tells GAME.EXE to lock its baud rate at
        xxxxx.  In order to get the most efficiency out of a high speed
        error correcting modem (9600 baud or above), you may lock the baud
        rate to a speed higher than what the caller is actually using.
        By locking the baud to say 38,400, the modem can compress text data
        that is being sent and achieve a baud rate much higher than the
        actual transmission rate.
        This will lock the baud rate at the same value for all nodes that
        use this command line.  If you perfer a more selective way to lock
        baud use 'LOCKBAUD' command in the GAME.CTL file.

        "/Cx"     (where x is 1..4) This specifies a comport number.
        Some bbs software does not create door information files (dropfiles)
        that contain the comport number.  If your bbs does have a comport
        listed in the dropfile then there is no need for this parameter.
        The default is comport 0, local mode.

        "/E" - Expanded Memory Specification If your machine has over one
        megabyte of memory, then you may have some available.  GAME.EXE can
        utilize EMS to improve game performance and reduce conventional
        memory requirements.
        This command will tell GAME.EXE   to use EMS memory to hold its
        overlay buffer.  Otherwise disc area may be used to hold this buffer.
        This needs a memory manager and when enabled and is compatible with
        DESQview. Default is NOT to use available EMS.

        "/L"      This tells GAME.EXE to load up in LOCAL mode.
        This is good for testing or when a sysop just wants to "try out" the
        door without messing with his BBS setup.  The "/L" mode will ask the
        user for his name and run the door in local mode.

        "/Nx"     (where x is 1..9) This specifies a "node number".
        Some bbs software support multinode environments in which you must
        know the node number of the drop file to use. For example, RBBS-PC
        uses DORINFOx.DEF. If you specified "/N2" then GAME.EXE would use
        DORINFO2.DEF.

        "/Mx"     (where x is up to 2 filename acceptable characters)
        Used to specify one of Multiple control files.  If you have created
        more than one GAME.CTL file (GAME1.CTL, GAME2.CTL, etc.) for each
        node or network PC then you can select the one you want by using
        the /M parm.
        Example:  "/M2" will force GAME.EXE to use GAME2.ctl.

        "/Pyyy"   This specifies the path to the drop files.
        For example, "/PC:\WILDCAT\WCWORK\NODE1" would tell GAME.EXE to
        look for the drop file in C:\WILDCAT\WCWORK\NODE1. If this is left
        out the program assumes the drop file is local.

        "/V"    This command will tell GAME.EXE not to show any display
        on the local screen.  Only a colored screen and a message will be
        displayed.  The cursor will not move as it will be turned off.
        Saves a little processing on multi-tasking systems.

        "/W"      This flags the program that a network is present even
        though no multitaskers are detected.  This is useful if the door is
        run on a network such as Novell that doesn't use multitaskers.


            COMMON ERRORS
            003  File path not found. Check to make sure the game
                 directory is correctly named as GAMEDIR.
            201  Files not found. Check to make sure that all required
                 games files are in the GAMEDIR directory.

        7. Install the door into your BBS software (see your BBS
           software documentation for more information).  A batch file is
           normally used to do this.  To run the program just have your
           batch file change to the THIEVES directory and run THIEVES.EXE -
           Thats all there is to it!  Two different batch files sample
           are included to help you run the game. These are included with
           the game for editing and your use. Remember when writing the
           batch routines for my games you must ensure that the game is
           run from it's home directory AND that the game knows where to
           find the drop file.  Satisfy these two requirements and you
           should have no problems running the game as long as the other
           setup criteria has been met. For dorinfo systems try using the
           following:

                            Sample Batch File
                            -----------------

                 COPY DORINFOx.DEF \RBBS\DOORS\GAMEDIR\*.*
                 CD \RBBS\DOORS\GAMEDIR
                 GAME x <-=- NODE number !!DO NOT USE "x"!!
                 del dorinfox.def
                 CD \WC30

            -->  Please note that you replace the "x" with the appropriate
                 node number. Ex: Dorinfo1.def ; Dorinfo2.def ; etc...


        8.  If you would like a score bulletin just have the game
            batch file copy the *SCORES.TXT file to wherever you have your
            bulletins. Example:

            Copy C:\PCB\DOORS\THIEVES\SCORES.TXT C:\PCB\BULL\BULL11.BBS

        9.  If you would like the events file to become a bulletin just
            have the game batch file copy the EVENTS.TXT and/or YEVENTS.TXT
            file to wherever you have your bulletins.  Example:

            Copy C:\PCB\DOORS\THIEVES\EVENTS.TXT C:\PCB\BULL\BULL12.BBS

            Note:  The scores.txt, events.txt, and yevents.txt file names
            are sysop defineable in the TGEDIT.EXE file.  If you have
            changed any of these file names then you must put those names
            in here also.

        10. Surprise!  There is NO separate daily maintenance to be
            performed. The first player of each day will automatically run
            the built in maintenance routines.


                     RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNREGISTERED GAME
                     -------------------------------------
        Until the game is registered the following restrictions are
        in effect:

            a.   There is a maximum of 8 players at a time in the game.

            b.   Many of the menu option 0's in most towns are disabled.

            c.  You cannot alter player stats in the TGEDIT.EXE program.

            d.  Registering the game disables all of the above and will
            allow player characteristics in a future version.

            e.  Once you are registered any future updates can be obtained
            free through my BBS and my upgrades are ALWAYS easy to
            implement!

            f.  I am periodically improving my games - so check my BBS for
            a more current version.

                         WHAT TO DO IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS
                         --------------------------------

        Every effort is made to ensure that the game runs correctly
        before it leaves my BBS as Shareware.  If you are experiencing
        problems please do the following BEFORE calling me:

        1.  Read ALL the SYSOP.DOC to ensure you have setup the program
            and have met all the program requirements.

        2.  Use the B4UASK.DOC as a checklist to ensure that you have
            not done anything wrong.


                                  Multinode use
                                  -------------
        This game supports multinode use and provides automatic
        multi-tasker support  (time slice releasing) for a wide variety
        of multi-taskers.

               Common Problems (Locked Bauds, High Speed modems, etc)
               ------------------------------------------------------

        1.   The game does NOT require a fossil driver to run.

        2.   If you are running a high speed modem (9600 baud or above),
             then I suggest you run your bbs/mailer/doors at a locked baud
             rate. On high speed error correcting modems, locking the baud
             rate will have a noticeable increase on the speed of text that
             is sent. It's beyond the scope of this document to discuss
             configuring your BBS and mailer for a locked baud rate; you may
             wish to consult those docs for information on that. Here are a
             few things to keep in mind when setting up GAME with a locked
             baud rate:

             a.  When using a locked baud rate, I highly recommend
                 using a  FOSSIL driver. This game will work at high
                 speeds without one though. BNU is a good fossil driver
                 which can even be loaded and unloaded before and after
                 you run this game.

             b.  If you are using a fossil, then make sure to tell the
                 fossil that the port is locked. For BNU, to lock com1:
                 at 38,400, you would use something like "L0=38400" on
                 BNU's command line.

             c.  If you lock the baud for one program, it must be
                 locked for everything. You can't lock the baud for just
                 this game, but not your BBS/mailer.

             d.  You may need to use the /B switch on the game.exe
                 Command line to specify the locked baud rate. For
                 19,200 this would be "/B19200" and for 38,400 this
                 would be "/B38400". Please note there is no space
                 between the "/B" and the baud rate.

        3.   What follows is some information on possible strange
             situations that may occur:

             a.  Low speed users can play the game, but high speed
                 users get garbage.
     
                 - If you are not using the DORINFOx.DEF or
                   DOOR.SYS drop file then you may wish to find a
                   converter program to convert whatever drop file
                   your BBS produces to the DORINFOx.DEF or DOOR.SYS
                   format and tell game.exe to use that.

                   Several converter programs are readily available
                   on most BBS systems. CallDoor is a good one if you
                   can find it. I have it on my BBS for download if
                   you need it.

             b.  The game hangs up when a user enters the game.

                 - Sounds like the game is getting the wrong baud
                   rate somehow. Try switching over to the DOOR.SYS
                   drop file method if possible.

             c.  Text and screens are getting cut off.

                 - If you are running with a locked baud, then this
                   could be caused by some sort of FLOW CONTROL
                   problem. Try using a fossil if you aren't already.

             d.  If you're using something other than the DOOR.SYS
                 drop file, then I always suggest trying to use
                 DOOR.SYS if possible. It is the most reliable method
                 and has had the most testing. If that is not possible
                 try DORINFOx.DEF as an alternative.

             e.  A door locks up node 1.  This can happen with fossils
                 or the internal communications routines because it
                 uses the default comport of 1 when NONE is found in
                 the dropfile or game.ctl file. To correct this make
                 sure the right port is shown in the dropfile OR
                 game.ctl file.

             f.  ANSI is reflected correctly on the local screen but
                 the user is getting garbage.  Assuming the user has
                 ANSI installed then most likely the problem is at
                 your end. First make sure you have configured the 
                 game.ctl file to show the correct locked port rate.
                 Second make sure the dropfile is passing the locked
                 port rate INSTEAD of the actual conncet rate.  If it
                 is not passing the locked port rate then you may
                 need to use a different dropfile format OR use a
                 dropfile converter program to change the line to
                 show the locked port rate INSTEAD of the actual
                 connect rate.

                            "Corrupted" data files
                             ----------------------
        It is possible that something could happen to your game
        data file.  A power outage, game crash, or other event could
        damage the data files.  If you get one of these messages,
        then the best thing to do is run the TGEDIT.EXE program to
        reset the game.

        GOOD people  who have made this door a possibility.

        Myron K. Crandall - Special thanks to Myron for translating
                            this door from the Atari ST to the IBM PC.
                            Many months of intensive work were required
                            to make my code readable and translate it to
                            the IBM platform.  Also for his willingness
                            to use his BBS as the support board (Deathmatch
                            BBS) for all future updates and bug fixes for
                            all Mythyn Software products.

        The DDPlus Team - Thanks to Scott Baker, Steve Lorenz,

                               Where to reach me
                               -----------------

        I can usually be reached at the Deathmatch BBS, which should be
        listed in the section entitled "registration" which is below.

                                  Registration
                                  ------------
        If you or your users enjoy this game, then please register it.
        Information on price and how to register is shown on the
        enclosed REGISTER.FRM.  Registration will disable the player
        limitation of 8 (allowing a maximum of 26 instead), allow
        additional town options and entitle you to life time support
        through the Deathmatch BBS.  BBS Support includes unlimited free
        updates and upgrades (not like some door game authors who charge
        for major upgrades/updates!) through my BBS and access to the game
        support conference on my BBS.  To register this game just print
        out the registration form (REGISTER.FRM) file included with the
        game and  send it with your check or money order to:

                               Mythyn Software
                               P.O. Box 1192
                               Orem, Utah 84059-1192


                           HOW TO REACH ME BY MODEM
                           ---------------------------

                             The Deathmatch BBS (USA)
                (801) 371-9132  (USR Sportster - 2400 to 28.8K V.34)

        Reminder: You will be mailed a LETTER with your registration
        code.  Just allow an appropriate amount of time (a week or two)
        after dropping your check in the mail for it to arrive to me
        and the code to be sent by mail back to you.  If you need it
        sooner log onto my BBS, leave me a message telling me you
        mailed the registration and when I receive your check or money
        order I will post a private message on the BBS giving you the
        key code.  If you do it this way please allow at least a week
        from the time you mail it to the time you call and get your
        code. If you go the BBS route you will ALSO receive a key code
        by mail.  If you need the most current version you must call
        my BBS for it.

                        Bug Reports/Comments/Suggestions
                        --------------------------------
        I have made every attempt to make sure the game is free of bugs,
        BUT the possibility always exists that one may have been missed
        by me or the playtesters.  If you find a bug, or have a
        suggestion or comment to make which would make future versions
        better please print out the BUGRPT.FRM and mailer, fill it out,
        and send it to me.  I read ALL of them and those people that
        lead me to find a bug or generate a better game will receive
        credit in the game documentation. PLEASE DO NOT NOTIFY ME OF
        PROBLEMS AND EXPECT ME TO FIX THEM IF YOU HAVE FAILED TO
        PROVIDE ME WITH THE BUGRPT.FRM AND OTHER INFORMATION I REQUIRE
        AS STATED IN THE B4UASK.DOC.

                          Planned Future Enhancements
                          ---------------------------

        Currently new ANSI graphics are being designed for a future release
        of this game.  Ripterm graphics support is on the list of things to
        do in the near future.  Registered SysOps will be able to obtain the
        new version without charge by calling the support BBS and downloading
        the current version.
