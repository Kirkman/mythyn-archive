A man sees thee, he says, "I heard the bartender wants to speak with thee!"
An eerie tone echoes through the sky...
A shooting star sails through the night sky...
A voice booms from the heavens!  The master says, "Watch thyself, mortal!"
Thou dost feel a strange presence, as though someone is watching thee!
Someone seems to be following thee from behind!!!
Thou hearest whispering coming from the shadows...
A chill runs down thy spine, in a strange sense of de ja vu!
