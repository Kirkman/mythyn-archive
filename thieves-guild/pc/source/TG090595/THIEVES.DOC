  IV. Credits

   I. The Night of Transformation

    You glance at your watch, then glance again--in the glow of the monitor,
your eyes sometimes play tricks on you.  No mistake--3:29 a.m. 
    You sigh, lean back in your chair, stretching.  Another night spent in a
modem marathon.  The area around your workstation reflects the night's
activities--leftover wrappers from various kinds of junk food, a few empty
cans of Jolt Cola, a stack of disks, and a long list of hastily scribbled
phone numbers.
    You scan the BBS list again.  Most of these you've already called--
Hackers' Haven, Gyrefalcon's Marches, Dark Fortress, Milliways, Random
Lunacy--but wait, what's this?  Latrocinio BBS... odd, you don't remember
having seen this one before.  It looks like a local call.  Well, just one
more, then you'll have to call it a night.
    You dial the number, wait a few seconds, and hear the click and the
high-pitched whine of the carrier tone.  But instead of connecting, the tone
only seems to grow louder--probably just your mind playing tricks on you. 
You give it a few seconds to connect, but nothing seems to be coming through.
    The tone is quite definitely louder now.  It's become almost hypnotic. 
You decide you'd better drop carrier and try again later, but something seems
to be keeping you from using the keyboard.  You feel almost paralyzed, pinned
to your seat, with the whine of the carrier tone growing ever louder and more
painful in your head.
    You gasp and tears form in your eyes.  It's impossible to think or even
breathe correctly as the noise continues to build, and you begin to lose
focus.  The room seems to fill with a purplish glow, shot with pink mist,
swirling about your head into a vortex that draws you steadily inward...
until you suddenly lose consciousness.

  II. THE QUEST

    You wake up slowly; your head is still spinning.  Your eyes are blurry,
and something must be wrong with your vision, because this certainly doesn't
look like your room.  As a matter of fact, it vaguely resembles tree
branches...
    You sit up suddenly; when your head stops whirling and twisting, you
stare in disbelief and shock.  You are sitting on dry ground, covered with
faded gold leaves, in the middle of a clearing.  Tall, golden aspens stretch
in every direction, quaking slightly in the breeze; the sky above you is a
brilliant shade of blue you haven't seen since childhood.  You get an eerie
feeling you're not in Kansas any more.
    Bewildered and frightened, you struggle to your feet, trying to make
sense of this madness.  You are surprised yet again as you stare down at
yourself--your clothing has changed as dramatically as your surroundings. 
You are now dressed a bit like a peasant out of a history book, in a cheap
but sturdy work shirt and pants.  A faded fabric bandanna lies on the ground
beside you.  As you stoop to pick it up, you hear a soft noise behind you.
    You spin about and, for the first time, notice yet another object in the
clearing--an imposing cabin-like building, rough-hewn from the same aspens
that surround you.  A sign carved in a runic language is posted over the
door, doubtless identifying it--assuming you understood the language.  Thick
blue-grey smoke issues from the chimney; someone must be at home.
    Your mind is beset with all kinds of questions and, since you are
unlikely to get an answer from any other source, you move cautiously toward
the building.  As you do so, the door opens and a dark, swarthy figure
appears.  He ambles out into the clearing, completely self-possessed, and
studies you from a comfortable distance, with what can only be an amused
look.
    "Who are you?" you burst out suddenly.  "Where am I?  How did I get
here?  What's going on?  Why--"
    "Peace, traveller," he rumbles, still calmly contemplating you. 
"Thou'rt disturbed and full of questions to be answered, but they must needs
be addressed within the Guild."  He indicates the building.  Finding yourself
at something of a disadvantage, you follow the dark stranger inside.
    The hall you enter is huge, open to the rafters high above and wide
enough that the corners are shrouded in darkness.  A large oak table, stained
dark with age, stands in the exact center of the room, illuminated by a
single massive white candle.  Here you are instructed to take a seat.  Shady-
looking folk peer at you from doorways--a spectrally thin man with long
clever fingers, a waif of a girl armed with a wicked-looking knife, a grey-
robed man with a blowgun and a bandolier strung with glistening black darts.
    Your host has seated himself opposite you; his dark eyes are wise and
compelling.  "Now to thy questions," he rumbles.
    "First of all," you begin, "I'd like to know where I am and how I got
here."
    "A simple start.  Thou'rt on Rogues' Isle, in the Forest Latrocinio of
the mountains, within the Great Hall of the Thieves' Guild."  You start up
with another question, but he silences you at once.  "This is not all, rash
youth.  There is more--and as every good thief can tell thee, knowledge is
the key to wealth."  You hear snickering from the doorways.
    "As a rule," the Master Thief continues, "time and space are smooth and
unbroken, and life is changeless as the sea.  But the sometime order of
things may go awry, whether due to some natural mischief or the workings of
evil magics, I know not.  Suffice to say that one such tear in Nature exists
in Latrocinio, within the clearing.  Through it many souls have wandered from
unknown realms, finding themselves before the Guild.
    "Long ago, it was accorded that we of the Guild would offer a hand of
friendship to these lost souls, by allowing them to join the Guild as
apprentices to the ancient art of thievery.  I know naught of thy world, but
here trickery, magic and evil abound, and thou wouldst do well to learn what
skill and craft the thieves may teach thee.  Hast thou the strength and
cunning to become a thief?"
    You hesitate only an instant.  The Master Thief's words are powerful,
spurring you to action.  "I have," you say.
    Suddenly, a dagger and a pouch rest on the table before you; startled,
you realize you never saw the Master Thief move.  "This dagger is thine, as
is the gold; if thou dost work diligently and become more skillful, we shall
reward thee in more worthy weapons and armour."
    Trying to act unfazed, you fold your arms matter-of-factly across your
chest.  "Anything else I need to know?"
    The Master Thief chuckles.  "Much, if I am any judge of character. 
Well, I would rather have thee too impetuous than too withdrawn.  Keep these
things in mind, then.  We are most lenient with new apprentices, but one rule
must always be obeyed--keep gold on hand.  If thou hast not at least one gold
piece on thy person, thou shalt be ejected from the Guild.  As far as other
help is concerned, the best help of all can be found from thy fellow thieves. 
Learn all thou canst from their rumours, speak to people thou dost meet, and
be sure to tip bartenders."  His eyes sparkle for a moment.  "Come now, there
is another work to be done."
    He leads you through a doorway and into a dark room cluttered with
scrolls, bottles and books of all kinds.  Five strangers in grey robes
surround you, palms out toward you, and begin making dark, guttural chants. 
The Master Thief explains that this spell will protect you from theft for
three days.
    "Protect me?" you exclaim, more than a little annoyed.
    "Thou hast much to learn, apprentice," the Master Thief smiles grimly. 
"While thou hast tarried here, no less than five thieves have turned thy
pockets inside out and found them empty."
    You decide, wisely, to keep silent.
    As you return to the main hall, you turn to the Master Thief again. 
"There's just one question you haven't answered yet.  How do I get back to my
own world?"
    "How do--"  The Master Thief's eyes turn sad.  "Young one, thou dost
fail to grasp thy situation.  There is no way back."
    "No way back?  What do you mean?"
    "The portal through which thou didst enter this world works only in one
direction.  I fear the only escape from this world is death.  Best accept thy
lot in life, and try simply to become a skillful thief."
    You stand flabbergasted in the main hall.  "No escape?  What about my
family?  What about my friends?  What about life in my own world?"
    "All lost to thee, I fear."
    "No!  If there is a way in, there has to be a way out.  Somewhere, there
must exist a portal that leads me back to my own world.  Rest assured that if
it exists, I will find it!"
 
                         ...And thus your quest begins...

 III. Introduction

         Welcome to the Thieves' Guild!!!  This game is the result of over
five years effort.  Rather than release beta & alpha versions during the
development process, it was tested on 2 BBSs and play-tested during that time.
It is to my knowledge the largest & most complex online game for a BBS to
date.  All play elements are involved, it is competitive between players but
also has an over all goal & non-repetitive design.  For Atari ST Users an
Emulator is available free of charge.  By no means required for play, it has
the following advantages:  instant menu display, visual effects, digitized
sound, and most of all some of the most impressive graphics & animation
anywhere!  If your SysOp does not have a copy online for you to download you
may call the Dark Fortress BBS to get it (updates as well) free of charge.

An IBM version of both Emulator & Online game are currently under way!  A
"stand alone" version is also available for both ST & IBM users, to play on
your own computer as much as you like; a great way to practice and discover
secrets.  Talk to the InnKeeper for details.

See Section IV ~ Credits for more information.  Over 400K in program & data
files.  Please thank your sysop for supporting shareware and registering
this program.

         Thieves' Guild is a VERY simple game to get used to.  Most can figure
out how to play without even reading these instructions, but those who do are
at a great advantage.  Hints, tips, & details are explained all throughout the
documentation.  If you wish, read only those chapters you want to know more
about, but I strongly suggest you at least look at Appendix A & B, and the
rest of this section.  These instructions would be much too long if I
described every aspect & feature, so much of it is left for you to discover
(besides, that is the funnest part of the game!).  Many quests, powerful
items, and treasures await your discovery!  Good luck as you seek the portal
back to Earth...

         As a member of the Thieves' Guild you are given certain requirements,
most important of these is gold.  You will NEVER be allowed to spend your last
gold piece.  If you ever end up with zero gold on hand (either by gambling or
getting robbed), you are deleted and must start over!  ALWAYS keep sufficient
gold on hand (money in the bank doesn't count, so be careful).  When you first
begin you are  given 3 days  of theft  protection.   This will prevent more
powerful thieves from making you go broke while you begin.

         Each day you are given 24 game hours to play (24 minutes in
real-time).  When you first go in it will be 12 o'clock, then the clock starts
ticking.  Each minute (real-time) will take off one hour game time, which
means the longest you may play each day is 24 minutes.  Chances are however,
that you will never play that long because there are many activities that use
time up quickly.  For instance sleeping, traveling, & training all use up time
quickly.  Certain places are only open during specific hours. To find out the
current time in the realm, visit the Inn.  If you exit the game before your
time is up it will be saved for you, should you decide to play again that day.
Every day after midnight your time is reset to 24 hours, bank interest is
paid, and the events file is reset.  The Sysop should put the Thieves' Guild
Events & Score list somewhere on the BBS for you to view.  If someone causes
you to go broke you can find out who it was by viewing the events.  If you go
broke, die, or are deleted for any reason you must wait a day before signing
up again (this gives an opportunity for other people to play if the game is
full).

         Your skill is what determines how well you steal.  You also have a
score.  Whoever has the highest score at any given moment is the Guild Master.
The guild master collects dues at random from other players (which can be
quite an income!).  At the end of the month whoever is the Guild Master is
added to the "Guild Masters" list which should be available on the BBS to
view.  Another list called "The Masters of Riddles" should also be on the BBS.
This is a list of those who have solved the quest and found the portal back to
earth (not an easy task)!  When someone enters the portal, all others are
trapped forever and the game is reset.  See Section I & II for more
information.

   -=*****************=-
     | The Main Menu |
   -=*****************=-

         Thieves' Guild has been organized to be "simple yet complex". It is
completely driven by menus & sub-menus which branch off into well over 350
possible menu options.  Everything begins with the main menu, at the top of
the menu you are shown the town's name that you are currently in.  Option #0
on the main menu is reserved for a "special" feature found in that town only.
When you have less than 6 hours left for the day a message will be shown at
the beginning of all menus: "Dusk Approaches".  It is best to avoid going to
the main menu as much as possible, for it is the equivalent of wandering the
streets.  It uses up energy and will cause drowsiness, hunger & thirst to
approach more quickly.  Anytime you type something at a menu prompt which is
not on the menu, it is just as if you "said" what you typed.  So if you wish
to say something out loud (such as a magic word), just type it at the main
menu prompt (Note:  This also uses up energy).

         Random events occur frequently throughout the game.  Most of them
will occur immediately after the main menu is displayed.  It is possible to
find objects in the streets, meet other people wandering the streets, and
even be attacked.  Often messages will be displayed reflecting weather
conditions or time.  You may notice the wind blowing, a moon in the sky or
other objects in the heavens.  Each and everytime the menu is displayed there
is a chance something will occur; sometimes good, sometimes bad.  If you are
hungry, thirsty, or otherwise afflicted you are notified at the bottom of the
main menu.

         Be sure to watch for option #0 on the main menu when visiting a new
town.  Visit all buildings when you first arrive somewhere new, no two towns
are identical.  Each shoppe or organization in a town has a unique name.  When
you learn the names in various towns it will help in locating a friend or foe
(when a thief steals from a merchant, the shoppe name is shown in the events
file).

   -=******************=-
     | Towns & Travel |
   -=******************=-

         There are 25 towns in all throughout the land, and each is individual
and unique.  As mentioned above, option #0 on the main menu is reserved for
any "special" place available only in that town.  Many of these special town
features are essential to solving your quest to return home.  Though almost
every town has a special aspect, only 3 will be described in detail (The
Stable, The Thieves' Guild, and Temples), the rest are for you to discover.
As you venture forth, and converse with other inhabitants of the land you may
gain hints to what is where.  It is wise to do price shopping, as no two towns
offer identical price ranges.  Prices in Shoppes, Taverns, Inns, Wizard's
Guilds, and Shipyards all vary greatly.  Some towns offer certain goods not
found elsewhere, so be sure to explore a great deal when arriving at a town
new to you.  You have the option of viewing town status at the main menu which
includes:  A brief town description, population, guards, and alignment.  The
usefulness of this information is explained throughout this documentation.

   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))
    )) Sailing the Seas! ((
   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))

         All towns are connected via specific travel routes. When traveling,
you are shown a list of all nearby towns.  The time necessary for a specific
voyage depends on several factors:  Distance, Weather, Ship/Horse Quality.
Before you can sail, you obviously must first purchase a boat.  You may talk
to a merchant at the Harbor (that is if the town you are in is by the ocean).
There are several different ship types such as rafts, canoes, sail ships, and
best of all, galleys.  The better the ship, the faster it will take you to
your destination.  Better ships also have better Hulls, which means they are
less likely to sink in adverse conditions (see Chapter 15 ~ Conflicts & Combat
for more information).  It is always wise to hire some sailors if your vessel
is big enough to carry them.  Sailors will help you fend off bad weather, sea
monsters, whirlpools, pirates, and other possible mishaps.  The longer your
voyage, the more likely you'll encounter these.  After you buy a ship it will
always be with you, as it will be moved to new harbors if necessary.  For
larger vessels, winds are required; watch the current weather conditions.  If
you notice banners flying the wind, or dust being stirred in the streets,
these are the most opportune times (though weather may change after you've
already set off).

Special ship items are rumoured to be available from select individuals.

   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))
    )) Land Travel ((
   ((-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-))

         There are many dark forest roads to guide the way.  Walking is one
way of getting around, but you may end up using all 24 hours of your day!
Travel by land should only be done on horseback!!  There is a Stable just
South of Arisilon (your starting point) in Jarsoloth.  Two types of horses are
available, Travel Horses, and War Horses.  Horses for travel are fine, but
only half as fast as a War Horse.  Though war horses are more expensive, they
are worth it.  A war horse is also less likely to be killed by a foe lurking
in the shadows, and will help you fight by kicking the enemy.  A travel horse
should only be purchased if that is all you can afford.  War horses may be
purchased with up to 24 hit points, for every 2 hit points your horse has it
will travel one hour faster.  When you buy your horse you may give it a name;
it's your new traveling companion! Some have made reference to a horse
training organization to the East.

Maps of all towns & travel routes are available.  They are EXTREMELY helpful
and full of stunning art work.  They are printed on parchment paper,
and full of hints!  They may be obtained by mail (within a week), talk to the
InnKeeper or look at Section IV ~ Credits in this documentation for more
information.

   -=***********=-
     | Casinos |
   -=***********=-

         Feeling lucky?  Try your hand at the games!  Watch your back
though, the pit boss isn't known to be a subtle loser (not a subtle winner
either for that matter)!

   -=***********=-
     | Taverns |
   -=***********=-

         All adventurers are familiar with the cozy atmosphere of the local
taverns.  This is a place to relax, socialize, and of course eat & drink!
There are, however, even more advantages to these gathering places, some not
quite as apparent.  Many wise and experienced travellers may share their
knowledge with you.  If you intend to succeed in your quest, and in over
coming your adversaries, this cannot be over looked.

    Food & Drink - Not all food is safe to eat, and unfortunately food
                   poisoning is not uncommon.  When selecting from the
                   menu it is wise to purchase the more expensive items
                   towards the end of the menu.  The more you pay, the
                   longer your hunger or thirst will be satisfied.  Don't
                   forget to tip the bartender!  He usually has a new
                   secret to share for every additional 100 gold pieces
                   you give him.  A wise man indeed!!!

    Jobs - Is your purse losing weight?  Jobs are frequently available,
           but often require decent apparel.

    Talking to Patrons - Relax & converse with the town folk!  They often
                         have important information to share with you.  Be
                         cautious however, not all are fond of new faces!

    Talking with the Bartender - Perhaps on rare occasions the bartender
                                 will have some time to speak with you.
                                 Just try to get his attention!

    Speak to a Guild Member - You may speak with any other thief that is
                              currently in town with you...

    Say something to everyone - Go ahead & yell out loud!  All will hear
                                what you have to say!

    Give someone some gold - Have a friend in need?  Sharing can be an
                             asset indeed!

    Listening & Telling Guild Rumours - Listen & tell rumours to the other
                                        thieves of the realm!

    STEAL!! - Food, wine, and gold lie behind the counter, perhaps when
              the Bartender is not looking you could relieve him of some!

   -=********=-
     | Inns |
   -=********=-

         The cozy warmth of a fireplace, warm blankets of fur, and rooms
to ensure you are not disturbed, are all available for a price.  Rooms of
various sizes and quality may be used at various rates.  The nicer the room
is, the better you will sleep.  Most Inn Keepers will let you sleep for up
to 12 hours at a time.

         Clocks & time pieces are rare in the land.  All Inns have a clock
which you may look at to plan your visits.  Because most all shoppes and
buildings are only available during specific hours, the Inn's clock is very
useful.  Fortunately Inns are open to visitors 24 hours a day.

         If you're low on gold, perhaps the Inn Keeper will have a job for
you.  If not, you can always sneak behind the counter while he's away!

  The Inn Keeper may also let you know how to obtain a map of the lands!

   -=***********=-
     | Temples |
   -=***********=-

         In the ongoing battle between order & chaos, institutions have
been organized.  Three prominent Gods are known throughout the lands.  Each
one of a separate alignment:  Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.  Temples for
each of the Gods have been erected in 3 different towns.  Generally the
influence of each temple radiates to the nearby towns.  The north-west is
known to be Lawful, the south is known to be Neutral, and the north-east
is known to be Chaotic.

         To join a particular religion you may be baptized or initiated
at the temple, for a ceremonial fee.  It is best to avoid towns of your
opposing alignment, and it's not wise to visit a temple of another religion.
You may convert to another religion, but the ceremonial fees are higher.

Here is a description of each God and what they stand for:

 * SOLNAR, Keeper of the Flame -- A lawful, righteous God of light!  Join
                                  if you seek peace, love, and improvement
                                  of self.  The 1st moon, the silver crescent
                                  in the heavens, represents his glory.

 * CATHRA, Goddess of Light -- The Neutral Goddess of the morning!  Seek her
                               mothering guidance if you seek justice,
                               knowledge, and purity.  The 2nd moon, the
                               pale light in the night sky, represents her
                               reign.

 * BALOR, Lord of the Night -- The Chaotic ruler of darkness!  Melt your soul
                               with his fiery kingdom if you desire vengeance,
                               downfall, and destruction!  The 3rd moon, the
                               crimson disc of the night's blackness, echoes
                               his name.

         There are two major advantages to joining a religion.  One of these
is the temple services.  Anytime you visit your temple you may praise your
God for one hour.  You will be instantly healed of all wounds, and your
energy will increase.  The other, and probably most beneficial aspect of
religions, is added Wizard's Guild privileges!  You will be offered an
additional 7 spells at the Wizard's Guild.  These are only offered at
Wizard's Guilds in a town of your own religion's alignment!!!

 (See Chapter 8 ~ Wizard's Guilds for a description of these spells)

     | The Thieves' Guild |
   -=**********************=-

         Hidden deep within the aspen forests, in the northern mountains
of Rouge's Isle, lies the gathering place of Thieves.  This is where you
found yourself when you first arrived in the Realm.  Here you will find
lessons in the art of Thievery.  Training sessions last 5 hours, and will
increase your skill up to 5 additional points.  This is a superb way for
the new thief to progress quickly.

         The Thieves' Guild is also a place for you to advance in your
experience levels.  When you have noticed you've gone up a level (by viewing
your stats), you may come for level advancement.  If the Master Thief finds
you deserving you will be given a new weapon & armour.  Your hit points will
also be increased.  It is wise not to advance too many levels before returning
to the Thieves' Guild.  Here is a list of each experience level, and the skill
points needed to achieve each of them:

      Skill Range      Experience  Level
     (-)(-)-(-)(-)     -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-

      0 - 84            Apprentice
      85 - 104          Footpad
      105 - 124         Robber
      125 - 144         Burglar
      145 - 164         Cutpurse
      165 - 184         Sharper
      185 - 204         Pilferer
      205 - 224         Thief
      225 - 264         Master Thief
      265 - 304         10th Level Master Thief
      305 - 344         11th Level Master Thief
      345 - 384         12th Level Master Thief
      385 - 455         13th Level Master Thief
      456 & Up          14th Level Master Thief

         You will be given a better weapon, and better armour with each
level advancement!  For more information on combat & weaponry, see Chapter
15 ~ Conflict & Combat.

         At the Thieves' Guild you may also purchase magical poison darts,
these, if they hit, will poison your foe.  See Chapter 14 ~ Magic Items for
information on how to use them.

   -=*****************=-
     | Wizard Guilds |
   -=*****************=-

         There are many masters of the magical arts throughout the realm,
and some make their services available for a fee.  Wizard's Guilds are
found in almost every town.  There you may visit and take advantage of both
their healing & destructive forces.  There are 7 basic spells that every
guild provides, though prices may vary greatly.  However, as mentioned
in the Religion chapter of this documentation, there are 7 additional
spells available only to those belonging to a particular faith.

         The spells suit the religion to which you belong, that is, if you
belong to the religion of Balor, your 7 additional spells are mostly for
destructive purposes, to harm your enemy.  Following are the 7 basic spells
available in every Wizard's Guild, regardless of your religion:

   1. Raise thy skill -- This enables you to pay a wizard to raise your
                         skill by magical means.  This is a quick  way to
                         get large amounts of skill points.  The price
                         per point gets more expensive depending on your
                         current skill.  You may buy 50 skill points max
                         at a time (it is a good idea to wait until you
                         can afford 50 skill at one time since the price
                         goes up the more you buy).


    2. Read someone's mind -- If the thief has no mind protection, this
                              enables you to find out how much gold they
                              have ON HAND only (not how much they have in
                              the bank).  This is useful to find out how
                              close your enemy is to going broke. You may
                              only cast this spell on someone who is in
                              town with you.

    3. Protect thy mind -- You may hire a wizard to protect your mind
                           from hostile magic such as Cursing, Mind reading,
                           Balorian sleep spells, and Balorian Death Gazes.
                           Mind Protection is purchased by how many days
                           you desire.  Once purchased, the only way it
                           may be destroyed is by a Balorian Mind Crush
                           spell.  It is wise to keep mind protection if
                           you have a lot of enemies.

    4. Curse thy foe -- If you wish to cause harm upon your enemy, this
                        is an option.  After cursing, the victim will
                        IMMEDIATELY lose 10 skill, and be Parched,
                        Starving, and stricken with Severe Fatigue.
                        Anyone without Mind Protection may be cursed. It
                        is sometimes wise to attempt to read someone's
                        mind before you curse them (to make sure they
                        don't have mind protection, since mind reading
                        is much cheaper).  The victim must be in town.

    5. Send a telepathic message -- This allows you to send a message
                                    to another thief even if he isn't in
                                    town with you.  Communicating in the
                                    Tavern allows you to speak only to
                                    those in town with you.

    6. Cure ALL of thy ailments -- The clerics of the guild will cure
                                   you of all ailments, such as poison,
                                   or any other strange ailment which
                                   might befall you.  This does NOT
                                   restore hit points.

    7. Heal -- An essential spell to keep your character alive. Rather
               than roaming the streets or tavern in search of a friendly
               cleric or priest, you may have your hit points restored
               here.  Price is for each hit point to be healed.

Here are the additional 7 spells for each religion, remember that these
spells are available ONLY in a town whose alignment is the same as your
current faith.  Because temples (where you get baptized into a religion)
are only available in the REGISTERED version of Thieves' Guild, these
spells will only be possible if your sysop is running a registered version
of Thieves' Guild:

  --*-- /@ Solnarian Spells @\ --*--
          [Lawful Alignment]

    1. Invisibility -- Purchased by individual days, this allows you to
                       be more transparent to other thieves.  Any time
                       other players view the list of thieves in town,
                       you will NOT be shown on the list.  If, however,
                       they select your player letter at the prompt
                       they will see you, and be able to interact with
                       you.

    2. Anti-Theft -- Exactly the same as the 3 day theft protection you
                     receive in the beginning.  No one may steal from you
                     while you've got it.  Once purchased (on a "by-day"
                     basis), it will stay with you as long as you don't
                     attempt to steal from anyone else.

    3. Increase hit points -- One of Solnarians best spells!  This allows
                              you to buy additional hit points (that is your
                              maximum hit points), rather than depending
                              on your level advances at the Thieves' Guild.

    4. Teleport Item -- Because of the generous nature of Solnarians, this
                        spell allows you to send gold to another thief
                        even if he/she is not in town with you.

    5. Enchant Weapon/Armour -- Increase the power & strength of your
                                current weapon or armour! Be cautioned
                                though, enchanted wares seem to take on
                                a life of their own!

    6. Transport -- When casted upon another thief, you will exchange
                    locations.  A great way to get quickly to a desired
                    town!  Also a great way to keep foes from getting to
                    where they want to go!

    7. Location -- Find out in which town a thief currently resides. It
                   is a good idea to cast this before a Transport spell
                   so you know what your destination will be!

  --*-- /@ Catharian Spells @\ --*--
         [Neutral  Alignment]

    1. Global Search -- This will list ALL thieves and the town they are
                        currently in.  A great spell to cast before a
                        transport spell if you have a particular
                        destination in mind!

    2. Universal Curse -- Exactly the same as regular Curse spell only
                          your foe doesn't have to be in town with you.

    3. Universal Mind Read -- Exactly the same as a regular mind read
                              except they need not be in town.

    4. Teleport Item -- Same as Solnarian Teleport Item spell (see above).

    5. Kill Assassin -- It is possible for your foe to hire a group of
                        assassins to seek your blood.  This will destroy
                        them before they destroy you.

    6. Transport -- Same as Solnarian Transport spell (see above).

    7. Location -- Same as Solnarian Location spell (see above).

  --*-- /@ Balorian Spells @\ --*--
         [Chaotic Alignment]

    1. Sleep Spell -- This causes a deep sleep to befall your foe.  Your
                      enemy will lose several hours of precious time in
                      the realm, and there will be no beneficial effects
                      of the sleep (if they were tired, they will still be
                      just a tired as before the spell).  Be cautioned,
                      you foe MUST have a full 24 hours left for that day
                      or the spell will fail!  Mind Protection also guards
                      against this spell.

    2. Universal Curse -- Same as Catharian Universal Curse (see above).

    3. Universal Mind Read -- Same as Catharian Universal Mind Read (see
                              above).

    4. Balorian Gaze of Death!!! -- This is the most HORRIBLE, Ruthless,
                                    and cruel thing to do to an enemy!!!
                                    Your foe will immediately lose 1/8th
                                    score, and 1/4th of their skill! Not
                                    only will your foe be Parched, Starving,
                                    and stricken with Severe Fatigue, but
                                    it will take a long time to restore
                                    these!  Your foe must be in an evil
                                    town, and without mind protection.

    5. Kill Assassin -- Same as Catharian Kill Assassin spell (see above).

    6. Mind Crush -- The ONLY way to destroy someone's mind protection so
                     you can send destructive magic their way!  Your foe
                     must be in a town of Evil Alignment at the time or
                     the spell will fail.

    7. Location -- Same as Solnarian Location Spell (see above).

Remember of course, as with the rest of this game, there are exceptions.
Certain guilds may provide "extra" services that are not found anywhere else
in the land.  I am not going to reveal the nature or location of them, it's up
to you to find them...

   -=*********=-
     | Banks |
   -=*********=-

         Every town in the realm offers a bank, but not all are created
equal...  Each bank offers different interest rates.  Be sure to keep in
mind that gold in the bank is not gold you have on hand.  So if someone
steals your last gold piece from you, you are kicked out of the Thieves'
Guild and must start anew (regardless if you have gold in the bank or not)!

         All banks are united, if you deposit your gold in one bank, you
may withdraw it from a bank in another town.  The daily interest rate you
are getting paid however, is the interest rate of the bank in which you
opened your account.  If you visit another town who's bank is paying higher
interest rates, it is a good idea to close your account & re-open it there!

         The last thing to consider when going to banks is the chance of
robbery.  Early in the progression of thieves your gold is fairly safe, as
it is difficult to rob the bank.  When thieves gain in skill however, your
chances of losing gold to fellow thieves is high.  Interest is paid right
after midnight, so if you are fortunate enough to be in before midnight,
deposit your gold then take it out after midnight!

         Here's what you may do at the Banks...

    Open an account - You may open an account at the bank, but you may only
                      have one account open at a time.  If you aren't sure
                      how much interest you are getting paid you can try
                      to open another account and you will be told.

    Close an account - By closing an account you will withdraw ALL your
                       gold.  You then may open another account somewhere
                       else.

    Withdraw from account - You may take gold out of your account at any
                            time, maximum 30,000 gold per transaction. At
                            least 1 gold piece must remain in the account
                            to keep it active.  If you want to take out all
                            the gold you must close your account.

    Deposit to account - You may put as much gold in your account as you
                         wish.  If your account has more than 99,999 gold
                         pieces in it you will not be paid interest.
                         Remember to always keep adequate gold on hand so
                         nobody causes you to go broke!

    Apply for a job - Banks are known to pay very well!

    Steal the Bankbooks! - Thinking about robbing the bank?  Want to know
                           how much gold your foe has?  By stealing the
                           bankbooks you will see the size of everyone's
                           stores!

    Rob the Bank! - VERY difficult except for the most experienced of
                    thieves!!  Penalties begin at 2 days in jail rather
                    than just 1.

   -=***********=-
     | Shoppes |
   -=***********=-

         Cloaks, hats, tunics, clothing of all colors & qualities are
offered here!  Certain shoppes are known to sell a rare selection of wares.
Dress yourself to fit your personality!  It is also wise for thieves to
change clothing regularly to prevent detection.  Most shoppe merchants are
willing to haggle on the prices, but are easily offended.

         When you successfully steal from a fellow guild member, all they
notice about you is your clothing, so change it often!

         It is always possible to avoid the merchant altogether and grab
something off the shelf!  No telling what you might get away with...

   -=*********=-
     | Jails |
   -=*********=-

         The jails are usually quite populated with those in the business
of thievery!  You may visit the jail and peer in the cells.  Have a friend
behind bars?  Pay bail, or, organize an escape!  Just be sure you don't
become a roommate!  Bail generally runs 500 gps/day.

   -=************************=-
     | The art of Thievery! |
   -=************************=-

         As a member of the Thieves' Guild, the majority of your prosperity
and success will come from pilfery.  It is wise in the beginning to avoid
stealing until your skill has increased considerably.  When stealing anywhere
(except from other Guild Members), if you fail guards will come after you.
When confronted with guards you have several options:  Attack them (you only
get this option if your skill is within a specific range), try to escape, pay
bail, or go to jail.  In most circumstances the penalty for a theft is one day
in jail, if the crime is more serious (such as a bank robbery attempt) the
penalty is two days.  If you go to jail and cannot afford bail, you must
either wait until after midnight (so you'll be out), or have a friend get you
out.  See Chapter 11 ~ Jails for more information.  If you try to escape and
fail, then you will be penalized with an extra day in the musty cell.

         Even if you have less than 100 skill it's not a bad idea to try to
steal from the Inn or Tavern when you have less than 3 hours left in the game
(since 3 hours aren't much, and you'll be out the next day), but don't try to
escape from guards!  For regular theft attempts it's best to wait until you
have around 150-200 skill, but it also depends on how many guards are in town.
You may view the town status to see the number of guards, the more there are,
the more difficult it will be to succeed.  Keep records of the towns you
visit, find a town with very few guards if you wish to steal from Inns, Banks,
Taverns, Shoppes & the like.  Success in helping a friend out of jail is also
influenced by guards (as well as trying to escape the guards).  Escaping
guards gets easier with more skill.

          There is an exception to this.  Stealing from civilians (pick
pocketing) is not at all influenced by guards in town, it isn't even
influenced much by your current skill level.  When you wish to pick pocket
find a town with a high population, the higher the better!!!  Even the least
experienced of thieves may participate in this activity (they just might not
get as much gold).  Be careful however, if the guards don't come after you,
the victim will!  Prepare to use your weapon if need be, nobody likes a
thief's hand in his purse!

           Stealing from other Thieves' (Guild Members) is also very
different...  Your success/failure ratio is in no way influenced by guards.
It is based on your current skill points, and the skill points of the victim.
If your skill is equal to each other then you've got a 50/50 chance of
success.  If you steal your victim's last gold piece then he/she is kicked out
of the guild and must start over!!!  When you succeed, you will also steal one
of their skill points.  If you fail, they get one of your skill points.  It is
against guild ethics to steal from a player who's skill you triple.  You also
may not steal from a thief with Theft Protection. If you try to steal from
someone and fail, they will see your name in their "Events while Gone", if you
succeed then they will see one item of your clothing.  You are only allowed 5
guild member steals per day.

Thievery, by far, will be the greatest source of income.

     | Inventory and Character Status |
   -=**********************************=-

         You have the option to view your status at any time.  By doing so you
will be shown all your statistics, such as:  Name,  Skill, Experience Level,
Weapon, Armour, Ship, Horse, Clothing, Religion, Gold, Theft Protection, Mind
Protection, Invisibility, etc.  Immediately prior to viewing your status you
will be asked if you wish to use one of your Magic Items.  See Chapter 14 ~
Magic Items for more information on this.

         There is another option on the main menu which will allow you to view
the status of other players.  If another thief is in town with you you may
look at them, the information provided is limited.  You will see their
clothing, horse, weapon/armour, and hit points.  If you desire more
information, such as how much gold they are carrying, you will have to read
their mind.  See Chapter 8 ~ Wizard's Guilds for more information on this.

     | Magic Items |
   -=***************=-

         Wands, rings, potions, and many other items which have been charged
with special energies by wizards.  When first entering the realm you are given
no magic items whatsoever, but many are found in the realm.  When looking
through your treasure after killing your foe, look carefully for anything
magic.  To view your magic items, select option #13 "View thy status" on the
main menu.  Just before viewing your status you are asked if you wish to use a
magic item.  You will be shown a list of all the magic items you have.  If you
wish to use one, just enter the number beside it.  In most cases, the first
time you use a magic item, you will not know it's effect or purpose.  Only
after using a magic item can you be sure.  Sometimes you won't even notice an
effect!  It is your job to figure out what its for and how/where you need to
use it.  BEWARE!  Though few, some magic items are dangerous!  Some evil magic
items are meant only to bring downfall upon the practitioner.  Through
experimentation and experience, you will learn how to harness the many
advantages of these mysterious trinkets.  Many magic items are essential to
solving your quest!!

         Potions are different than most magic items.  They must be either
used immediately or discarded.  Some potions are beneficial while others are
very harmful.  Each potion has a distinct color, it is a **VERY** good idea to
write down a potion's color & it's effect once discovered!  This will let you
know what to do in the future when you find that potion again.

         Magic items are found in a wide variety of locations.  Some you'll
find in treasure chests, some you may even find just lying in the street!  Or
perhaps maybe some kind soul may give you one for no apparent reason!

   -=*********************=-
     | Conflict & Combat |
   -=*********************=-

         Not all inhabitants of the realm are friendly, and no doubt the
time will come to defend yourself!  Upon entering the realm you are provided
will only a dagger & clothing.  Better weapons & armour may be obtained at
the Thieves' Guild. For more information, see Chapter 7 ~ The Thieves' Guild.

         Your thief has hit points, which are familiar to those who play
role playing games.  They are your life's essence, and when they are gone,
your character dies.  You may be healed at the Wizard's Guild, by potions,
or by a friendly Cleric/Priest seen wandering the streets or Tavern.

         You will be challenged by civilians occasionally if you are pick-
pocketing, and even some will challenge you on the streets without cause.
Patrons in taverns, wild animals, monsters at sea, dark travel routes; enemies
are found all throughout the land.  Here we will explain some of the attack
strategies.  You will notice in the beginning that MANY powerful enemies will
challenge you, but then refuse to fight you because you are so weak.  If your
hit point maximum is too low, then some creatures will turn you down.  This is
to protect you as you become more powerful.  It is dangerous to have low
skill, and a lot of hit points!!  Skill & Hit points are the key to effective
self defense (a nice weapon/armour don't hurt either!).  When engaged in
combat you are given a list of attack techniques. They are different depending
on the weapon you have.  Here is an example:

                             [1] Defensive Strike

                       [2] Slash     *-*-*-*   [3] Stab
                       [4] Thrust!    *-*-*    [5] Lunge!

                            [6] Two-Handed Attack!!!
                             >> [T]ry to Escape! <<

        If you choose a higher attack style, such as #6, you will be less
likely to hit, however, if you do hit you'll do more damage!  It is possible
for your foe to knock your weapon out of your hand. If this happens you will
have the option of fighting bare-handed, or to attempt to recover your weapon.
Once you've chosen your attack style, you then may choose a target:  Head,
Chest, Arms, or Legs.  If you go for the head, you may do slightly less
damage, but there is a chance you will stun your foe, rendering them unable to
attack for some time.  If you go for the legs, you may knock them down.  If
you attack their arms, you may knock their weapon out of their hands.  The
best target to do damage is the Chest, but there is no chance of putting your
foe out of commission for some time.

        Occasionally, when your foe is close to death, they may beg for mercy
or flee the battlefield.  If you are close to death, and you know that you are
about to receive a fatal blow, you may drop carrier (hang up your modem).  Be
sure you do it BEFORE you lose your last hit point however, Thieves' Guild
saves all information when carrier is lost, but does not save the fact that
you were in a fight (***NOTE:  On many BBSs it is considered rude to hang up
while online, many sysops discourage it!  Be sure you know where your sysop
stands on this before hanging up).

         If you are travelling while attacked, things are slightly different.
If sailing, your foe will not attack you, it will attack your vessel.  Your
vessel's Hull Points are like your hit points.  When the Hull is gone, your
vessel is destroyed.  When you successfully arrive at your destination your
ship is repaired at the Harbor.  If travelling by land, your horse will help
you attack your foe, but your foe will also occasionally attack your horse!

         After a battle you get the reward!  You will receive additional
score, and if it's been a particularly tough battle, you may also receive
skill & hit points.

         You may also find a treasure chest, which may contain a lot of junk,
or a lot of wares!  Gold & magic items are the most beneficial items found
after a battle.  Watch carefully for a magic item when looking in the chest!
Junk such as dishes, rags, & other unimportant objects are discarded.

         See Chapter 14 ~ Magic Items for more information on these.

                   --==*** HISTORY, FOLK LORE, MYTH ***==--

 Following is a brief historical account from King Tarsol's archives:

      "Many years ago, when the light of Solnar illuminated the realm, a sacred
pact maintained law & order.  Now known as the "Ancient Ones", these select
individuals were masters of the mystical arts.

      Through these arcane forces they created a "Magic Circle", this circle
served as a sort of shield from outside influences.  After several decades of
peace & light, a horrible influence befell the realm.

      A special child was born.  As he moved into childhood his rapid
magical progression became evident.  The Ancient Ones had high hopes for this
child sorcerer.  At age 13, the child was visited by an evil entity.  The
Chaotic God Balor himself manifested before him.  Seduced by promises of
power & influence the child succumbed to temptation.  He rapidly declined into
the black arts, and by adulthood had broken away from society.

      As his influence spread, his name, Zolar, was known throughout the land.
A Balorian Temple was raised in his name, and his minions began to spread.  The
tension was building, and the Ancient Ones knew something had to be done.  A
great battle between Law and Chaos suddenly broke loose.  The battle was over
almost as quickly as it began.  Tremendous losses were on both sides.  Zolar
ultimately was killed, but things have never been the same.  The land split
up, & new continents were formed overnight. Even residents of the Fairy World
felt the consequences.

      In the midst of the confusion a third religion came to light.  A temple
was constructed for the Neutral Goddess Cathra.  Wizards of each alignment
joined to create villages of their own, known as Magi Rule towns.  It is said
that the last of the Ancient Ones hid their residence through magical means,
though very few seem to confirm there even exists a Solnarian Magi Rule
village.

      Some of Zolar's most elite followers even today attempt to raise the
void, which was Zolar's ultimate goal.  It is believed if this is done, Balor
himself will live and rule on the planet.  The void has been successfully
created in a small portion.  Many sailors report seeing some sort of "shadow"
while at sea among the stormy clouds.  Perhaps this is part of the void
itself."

      There are far too many people who have contributed to the production of
Thieves' Guild over the past 5 years to list them all here.  I would, however,
like to mention the following names:

                         -*- Gerald Homeyer (Groo) -*-

                  In the beginning, when the game was nothing
            more than a menu outline, his suggestions & enthusiasm
                        set my imagination into motion.

                      -*- Suzanne Buck (Pirate King) -*-

         Thanks to Suzanne for donating her excellent writing skills.
       She is responsible for the entire Thieves' Guild intro storyline.

                     -*- Herb Flower (The Alpha Male) -*-

        Not enough can be said for all the work that Herb has put into
     this project.  From the Thieves' Guild Map artwork, to the extensive
           programming, graphics, and animation of the TG Emulator.

         His ideas have shaped the course of Thieves' Guild as much as
                mine.  His effort is evident from every aspect.

  -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
        Thanks also to Robert Fletcher for helping Herb in the initial
  Emulator development.  Mitch Calahan, for his keen eye on bugs <G>. Thanks
also to all the many others who have in their own way made TG what it is today.
