To install Thieves' Guild you need to do the following:

  1.  Unzip it into its own directory.
  2.  Create a DATA directory within the current directory.
        Type 'MD DATA' from dos command line.
  3.  Option 1.  Run TGEDIT and follow instructions.  It should be intuitive.


        Enter all the information it asks for.  When it asks for a path/folder
        you need to enter the complete path name.  I.E. 'C:\PCB\DOORS\TG\DATA\'
        including the end '\'.  When it asks for a file name, enter a complete
        filename.  I.E. 'C:\PCB\DOORS\TG\EVENTS.TXT'.  For the data directory
        it is recomended you choose the DATA subdirectory.  For all other
        directories, use the THIEVES.EXE directory.  If you choose a different
        path for the other thieves path, then the following files must be
        located in that directory:

          TG_MSGS.DAT   (steal from other player messages)
          THIEVES.ANS   (Thieves' Guild intro ANSI Screen)
          THIEVES.DOC   (Document/instructions on play)
          THIEVES.SCR   (Thieves' Guild intro VT52 Screen)
          TOWNS.DAT     (Town data file)
          RUMOURS.DAT   (Player Rumours file)
          RUMOURS       (Game Hints and rumours)

        Enter 'Q' to quit the editor.  Your changes will be saved.  You can
        later enter the editor to create a new game or modify a player.
        This will save three files:
          THIEVES.SET  (configuration file, can be edited with a text editor)
          THIEVES.DAT  (player save game data, use only the editor)
          THIEVES.CLK  (thieves mainenance file, should have two lines with 0)

  4.  Edit a batch file to run Thieves' Guild.  For PCBoard it would look like
      the following:

        %pcbdrive%:
        cd %pcbdrive%\pcb\doors\tg

        rem the /p specifies the location of your drop file
        thieves /p%pcbdrive%%pcbdir%

        %pcbdrive%
        cd %pcbdir%
        board

      THIEVES.EXE accepts as a parameter the code '/p' to specify the path
      of the drop file.  It is in the form: 'thieves /pC:\PCB\NODE1'.

  5.  Edit THIEVES.CTL.  It should look like the following:

        SYSOPFIRST <SysOp First Name>
        SYSOPLAST <SysOp's Last Name>
        BBSNAME <BBS Name>
        BBSTYPE <either PCB15 or DOORSYS>
        STATUS <ON or OFF>
        STATFORE 7
        STATBACK 1
        PAUSECODE @PAUSE@
        MAXTIME <max time in door, 30 recommended>

      Fill in the <> appropriately.  To use PCBOARD.SYS, specify PCB15 or
      to use DOOR.SYS, specify DOORSYS in BBSTYPE.  Other BBS's are
      supported.  For a list of all other BBS's and how to configure for
      them, see the DDSETUP.DOC file and DDSETUP.EXE.

      To enable the status bar on the bottom of the screen, enter ON for
      STATUS else OFF to disable it.

      This file is in the DDPlus style and therefore the program DDSETUP
      may be used to edit it.  This ZIP has been included with Thieves'
      Guild to aid in setting up the THIEVES.CTL file as a courtesy.
      Thanks are due to Steven R. Lorenz for developing this aid.


  6.  Try the game out from the BBS.

These instructions should get you up and running with no further
configuration necessary.  If a file is invalid, when running the game, it
will be displayed so that it can be fixed.


Note:
  At present, Thieves' Guild does not support multiple nodes playing
  concurrently.  SHARE must be installed if your BBS is a multi-node
  system else it may cause the system to lock if two nodes try to
  play at the same time.  It is still in Beta and this version will
  lock out other nodes while someone is playing and possibly a version
  will be released that will allow concurrent use with multiple nodes.

  Also, if a player drops carrier in the game, it will not save the
  game.  In a later release with a drop carrier the players turns will
  be saved.

  The game currently recognizes a drop carrier and has a three minute
  timeout before kicking the player out of the game.
