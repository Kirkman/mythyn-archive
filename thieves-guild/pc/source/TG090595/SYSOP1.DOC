                    Thank you for supporting ShareWare!!!!


You should have received the following items in your package:

       - Map of Thieves' Guild travel routes.  This is the same map that we
         send out to Users who order one.

       - 1 Disk containing the following files:

          LZH201L.TTP - Use this to extract the files from THIEVES.LZH.
                        Pass "x THIEVES.LZH <destination>" in.

          EMULATE.LZH - This is a file archived in LZH format.  It is the
                        "Thieves' Guild Emulator" which may be used by your
                        Atari ST Users.  It will give them graphics,
                        animation, and digitized sound.  This file should be
                        placed in the files section on your BBS for users to
                        download.  This file IS public domain.

THIEVES.LZH - Archive containing the following:

           EDITOR.TOS - This is the Editor, used to install new games, edit
                        the THIEVES.SET file, and delete/edit players.

          THIEVES.TOS - This is the main executable file.

            SYSOP.DOC - This documentation in ascii format.

          THIEVES.DOC - This is the game documentation file.

          THIEVES.DAT - This is the file where player's information is kept.

          THIEVES.SET - This is an ASCII text file where paths are set for
                        events files, and game files.  This is also where you
                        tell Thieves' Guild what BBS Software you are using.
                        This may be edited with EDITOR.TOS, or with any ascii
                        text editor.

          THIEVES.SCR - This is the VT52 intro screen.

              RUMOURS - This file contains rumour information, hints to quest,
                        etc.  This file is used by the game for hints told by
                        civilians.

          RUMOURS.DAT - This file contains GUILD RUMOURS (rumours entered by
                        players).  This may be edited provided that the number
                        at the top of the file is equal to the number of
                        rumours in the file.  Each rumour may not exceed 80
                        characters.

            TOWNS.DAT - This is the file that stores all vital town info.

          TG_MSGS.DAT - This is a file of 8 quotes which the sysop may induce
                        at any time during a user's game.  If you wish to
                        customize them, you must use a text editor of some
                        sort.

  -=*******************=-
    | Getting Started |
  -=*******************=-

         Please verify that everything has been included in your package, and
all the files are on your disk.  You may also want to make a backup of the
original disk before beginning installation.  If you have any problems, or
anything seems to be missing, don't hesitate to call our support BBS!!

         Because the Registered version of Thieves' Guild is so much larger
and more complex than the Unregistered version, you will need to delete ALL
the files that came with the Unregistered version archive.

         I would also ask, if you have not already done so, that you put the
EMULATE.LZH file on your BBS for users to download.  This file IS public
domain and may be distributed in Computer User Groups, BBSs, Online Services,
and shareware libraries.  Everything else in your package is NOT shareware,
and is licensed for your use only.  PLEASE NOTE: If you change your BBS name,
or BBS Phone Number, notify us immediately on our Support BBS.  We will
promptly provide you with a new version containing the updated information.

         Now, let's get your new version online!!!

  -=****************=-
    | Installation |
  -=****************=-

         Installation should be simple, because it's almost exactly the same
as it was for the Unregistered version.

         Step #1: Decide on a Path/Folder which will hold all your Thieves'
                  Guild files.  On my system I use C:\FOREM\THIEVES\ ...
                  Create the new folder and copy ALL the files (except
                  EMULATE.LZH) from your disk into it.

         Step #2: Create another folder (preferably inside the folder you just
                  created) to hold all the "Events While Gone" files.  I use
                  C:\FOREM\THIEVES\DATA\.

         Step #3: Now load EDITOR.TOS on your Hard Drive in the Thieves Path.
                  The Editor program makes installation easy, and makes game
                  maintenance clean & simple.  With it you may also edit
                  entries in the setup file THIEVES.SET; it stores information
                  such as Paths, ascii data filenames, and BBS type.

                  DON'T BOTHER CHANGING THESE LINES YET, YOU WILL BE PROMPTED
                  TO ENTER EACH OF THEM WHEN YOU [I]NITIALIZE NEW GAME.

            The lines in THIEVES.SET are as follows:

               Line 1: Data Path -- (ie C:\FOREM\THIEVES\DATA\)

                       This is the path you chose, & created
                       for the "Events While Gone" files.

               Line 2: Thieves Path -- (ie C:\FOREM\THIEVES\)

                       This is the path you created for all
                       the Thieves' Guild files.

               Line 3: Events Path & filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\EVENTS.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file for viewing the game Events which
                       have transpired today.

               Line 4: Yesterday Events Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\YEVENT.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file for viewing Events from
                       Yesterday.

               Line 5: Scores Path & Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\SCORES.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file containing a list of all current
                       players with skill, scores, religion, and current Guild
                       Master.

               Line 6: Guild Masters Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\MASTERS.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file listing all Guild Masters from
                       past months.

               Line 7: Riddle Masters Filename -- (ie C:\THIEVES\RIDDLES.TXT)

                       This is an ASCII file listing all Riddle Masters.

               Line 8: BBS Program -- (ie FOREM, EXPRESS, or OTHER)

                       Thieves' Guild is written to work with Forem's
                       DORINFO1.DEF file, or EXPRESS's method of passing the
                       username in.  Mainly because almost all other BBS
                       programs are compatible with either of these two
                       methods.  If your BBS program is NOT capable of this,
                       then select [O]ther.  The game will then run with
                       password.  If you go by [O]ther then it will be
                       possible for users to have more than one character in
                       the game; so by all means only use the password system
                       as a last resort!

               Line 9: Forem Data File -- (ie C:\FOREM\DOORS\DORINFO1.DEF)

                       If you are using forem, this is the location & filename
                       which holds the username information.  Inside the file,
                       the user's first name is on line 7, last name is on
                       line 8.

                       If you are not using FOREM then this line of the .SET
                       file is ignored, and doesn't even need to be there.


           You may want to make the ASCII files (Events, Yesterday Events,
           Scores, Guild Masters & Riddle Masters) viewable on your BBS
           somewhere.  Players may view them from within the game as well
           however...

           More about the Editor later, for now just select [I]nitialize
           new game.  This option is for first-time installation only.
           You will sequentially be asked for paths & filenames which will
           be used by the game; so have an idea of where you want them.

         Step #4: After answering all the questions, press 'Q' to quit the
                  editor, BE SURE to save all the changed information.
                  Next, copy the now modified THIEVES.SET file to the
                  path/folder your BBS is executed from.

         Step #5: Thieves' Guild is now Installed!!  The only thing you need
                  do now is add it to your BBS's DOORS menu.  You will also
                  need to pass in the parameter "LOCAL" for the game to run
                  while executed locally (not over the modem).  For Forem, the
                  entry in your FDOORS.DAT file would look something like
                  this:

                       -=* The Thieves' Guild *=-
                       10
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.WEL
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.TOS
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.TOS Local
                       C:\THIEVES\THIEVES.EXI

                  If you chose EXPRESS as your BBS type then you must pass in
                  the user's name after the LOCAL parameter.  Remember only
                  pass in the LOCAL parameter for games NOT being played over
                  the modem.

  -=**************=-
    | The Editor |
  -=**************=-

         Apart from editing the THIEVES.SET file, the editor is capable of a
few other things.  Use "[C]reate a new game" to reset the game in progress.

         If your THIEVES.DAT file ever happens to go corrupt for some strange
reason, you can have the editor create a new one by just deleting the old one
and running the editor.

         You also have the option of editing a player (no, not to cheat :).
If you change the user's name on the BBS, then you also need to change the
player's BBS name with the editor so Thieves' Guild will still recognize them.
You may also change a player's game name, or delete a player.

         There is an option of setting a player's "last play day to today".
This you can use to prevent a user from being deleted due to inactivity (a
nice thing to do for one of your user's that is going on vacation).  The
inactivity limit is 10 days, if a user does not play for 10 days straight,
they are deleted to free up slots.

    | Misc. Features |
  -=******************=-

          There are a couple of new special features available in the
Registered version for the SysOp.  One of these is the ability to play the
role of Bartender in the Tavern.  When a player chooses to "Talk with the
Bartender" in the Tavern, you will be paged.  You then may break in and
talk to the player as though you were the bartender, it isn't quite real-time
so it isn't so obvious that it's really you.  If you speak carefully the user
may not even realize he/she is talking to a real person!  You may also select
facial expressions & actions throughout chat.  So if you're around while
someone is playing, have at it!

           There are also 8 Sysop "Hot Keys", stored in the file TG_MSGS.DAT.
These are special "messages" that may be triggered by the sysop while someone
is in the game.  Just press a number between 1-8 while text is BEING SENT to
the user. A message will let you know that your request has been acknowledged.
The next time the user goes to the main menu, the message corresponding to the
number pressed will be displayed.  You may change the messages to anything you
would like, but each message may not exceed 80 characters.  For your
reference, these are the messages in the file that came with your disk:

1> A man sees thee, he says, "I heard the bartender wants to speak with thee!"
2> An eerie tone echoes through the sky...
3> A shooting star sails through the night sky...
4> A voice booms from the heavens!  The master says, "Watch thyself, mortal!"
5> Thou dost feel a strange presence, as though someone is watching thee!
6> Someone seems to be following thee from behind!!!
7> Thou hearest whispering coming from the shadows...
8> A chill runs down thy spine, in a strange sense of de ja vu!

           Any text editor will work for editing these...
