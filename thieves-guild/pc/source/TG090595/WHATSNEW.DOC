THIEVES.EXE
  * When a runtime error occurs, a file will be written out describing
    the error and the location of the error.

  * Now when user drops carrier or times out, the game will be saved at
    the current status.  (Including Run Time errors if possible)

THIEVES.EXE
  * Thieves' Guild now supports file locking.  It still does not support
    more than a single user play at a time BUT it will recognize when
    another player is playing and will lock everyone else out.  SHARE is
    now required to be loaded if you have a multi-node BBS.  If it is not
    loaded then no file locking will be used.

TGEDIT.EXE
  * Now you no longer need to specify a BBS Type nor path to the drop file.
    It will automatically get the needed information from the THIEVES.CTL
    file provided by DDPLUS.

THIEVES.EXE (main program)
  * Fixed to work as the unregistered version adding a limit of 8
    players max and disabling the option '0's in most towns for the
    unregistered version.

TGEDIT.EXE (new editor)
  * Wrote a new editor for setting up Thieves' Guild that is more intuitive
    and easier to use.  Still includes editor.exe for the old timer
    sadists who actually prefer it!

THIEVES.EXE (main program)
  * Telling rumours in the Tavern now works
  * Fixed viewing daily events when view first time after midnight



06/08/95

THIEVES.EXE (main program)
  * Fixed the lost file chain problem that occurs daily leaving
    a lost cluster containing Thieves' Guild daily events

  * Fixed the crash upon exit

  * Made the problem analysis of missing files more intuitive telling
    the SysOp exactly what file (including path) was incorrect

  * Lowered the number of files opened at a time


EDITOR.EXE
  * Fixed the [I]nitialize section to properly ask for location of
    drop file when you select PCBoard.


Known Bugs:
  * At times under OS/2 with only 8 Meg of ram it is VERY slow.


Special thanks to the DDPLUS team.  Thieves' Guild is another fine DDPLUS
door.
