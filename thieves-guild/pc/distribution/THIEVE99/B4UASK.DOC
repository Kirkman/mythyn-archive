
                      CHECKLIST FOR SETUP/PLAY PROBLEMS
                      ----------------------------------

  Before you assume there is something wrong with the game or you
  cannot get them to run on your system please check the following.
  If you answer yes to any of them you are doing something wrong.

  Thieves' Guild

      _____  - You forgot to make sure SHARE is loaded IF you are
                running multi-node OR under desqview.  Not required
                for single node operation.

      _____  - You forgot to configure the THIEVES.CTL file first.

      _____  - The start up batch routine does not tell the game where
                the drop file can be obtained and what node is playing.

      _____  - You attempted to alter the TGBBSREG.CFG without obtaining
               the correct key code from me directly or you created this
               file.

      _____  - You are running a fossil but forgot to configure the
                CTL file to show that you are using a fossil and at what
                speed you have locked the port.

      -----  - You have not tried to change to a different drop file format
                to see if that might be the problem.

      -----  - You do NOT have ALL the game files in the same directory?

  OK, I have not done anything wrong based on the above.  What do I
  do now?  If it is a game problem fill out the bugrpt.frm completely
  and then package it up with any error logs (ERROR.LOG), your THIEVES.CTL
  file and the batch routine which runs the game, and transmit it to me
  via Snail-Mail or log onto my BBS and upload it to me.  Use the first 8
  letters (or less) to name the package. For example HELPME.ZIP would be
  the name of my compressed package containing the BUGRPT.FRM and other
  required files which I might submit. Please note that I will NOT
  respond to ANY inquiries or bug reports unless I get these things!
