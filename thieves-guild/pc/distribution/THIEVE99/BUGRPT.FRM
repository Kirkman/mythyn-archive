                     BUG REPORT/COMMENT/SUGGESTION FORM
                     ----------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING OUT THIS FORM:  I sincerely want to resolve any
problems you encounter with my games but to do this I must have accurate
and concise information on the problem. Too many people call me and expect
me to resolve their problem on nothing more then "it does not work". That
simply will NOT work to resolve the problem.  Before you fill this form out
I request that you complete the B4UASK.DOC checklist to make sure you have
not forgotten to do something in the setup of the game.  If that does not
alleviate the problem then the next step is to completely fill this form out
AND package it up with any error logs, batch routines and the CTL file
and snail-mail it to me at my P.O. Box OR upload it to my BBS. Please
note that I usually do not respond to inquiries unless it is either through
my BBS or through snail-mail (US Postage).  If you want a reply then you
must log onto my BBS for my reply to your message.
My support BBS can be reached at (801) 371-9132 (2400 to 28.8 baud).
